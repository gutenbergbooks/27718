<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_dropi.png" width="123" height="175" alt="I" style="margin-top: -1em;"/></span><span class="upper">n</span> the days of the long-ago, my ancestors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
did not dwell as we do now&mdash;in
brooks or by the banks of shallow
streams, but grew in wild luxuriance beneath
the shade of overhanging trees, and
under the wayside hedgerows.</p>

<p>We were always a quiet, unassuming race, and,
indeed, I am fain to confess, were not held in
more esteem by mortals than are our sweet cousins
whom children call 'Bird's-eyes.' But some one
made known to the world that pathetic 'Legend
of the Rhine,' in which we are described, then
people began to perceive that we were pretty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>lovely
indeed,&mdash;and to make a great fuss about us;
but such is the way of the world!</p>

<p>Yet, though that legend is tenderly beautiful
and thrilling, it is almost too romantic to please
the taste of simple flowers, therefore I will tell
you the true story how we acquired our name.
That shall be my parable&mdash;see what it will teach!</p>

<p>We grew there, unheeded and unsought, on soft
mossy banks, not the less lovely because unknown,
and just above our dwelling-place a large oak
spread abroad its leafy branches. It was a
favourite tree of the birds, they felt so secure
there, sheltered from prying eyes by its protecting
leaves; besides, its branches were so firm and
strong, they resisted bravely the fury of the storms
that swept over them. What bird, then, would
fear to build its nest there? And often have we
listened to their sweet songs as they perched above
us, and many times lifted our heads and gazed
upon the happy inmates of those simple homes.</p>

<p>But there was one family among them that
interested us even more than others, though all
were dear to us. It was a pair of wrens who had
by some strange accident taken up their abode in
our oak, instead of a yew-tree as they generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
do; and not only my family, but the whole colony
of birds, old inhabitants of the tree, many of them,
felt great interest in the new-comers, assisting
them with advice, as they were but young.</p>

<p>Then, when building time came, how kind they all
were! indeed, though it was a busy season with
every bird, each anxious to finish its work, yet I
heard an old Rook one day ask little Jenny Wren
'if he should help her,' as he met her trying to drag
a large wisp of straw with all her tiny strength.</p>

<p>'No, thank you,' she gently replied; 'I must try to
do it. We must all learn to bear our own burdens.'</p>

<p>But many times, however, I have seen the
larger and stronger birds bring materials for
making the nest close to the spot they had chosen,
to save the little strangers weary journeys; and
at last, after much patient labour, the home was
finished, to the intense delight of the two builders,
for both took their share in the work; but the joy
was greater, when, after some time, three little
birds made their appearance in the compact and
cosy nest.</p>

<p>The event caused quite a sensation among the
other dwellers in our old tree. Jays were constantly
inquiring how the nestlings were getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
on, an inquisitive Magpie peeped into the nest,
trying to get a glimpse of the pretty ones, and
received a sharp peck from the angry father as a
reproof for the intrusion; as to the motherly Rooks,
who were supposed to care for nothing save their
own family concerns, they kindly advised the
young parents how to rear the brood, saying,
'Care, care,' was all that was necessary; nay, it
is even recorded, as an undoubted fact, that an old
Owl, who had lived for ages in a hole in the tree,
actually opened her eyes quite wide when the
news was first told to her, although it was broad
daylight! You may imagine, then, how happy
they were, surrounded thus by kindness and love;
and yet&mdash;I suppose it is but right there are ever
shadows as well as sunshine, and, sad though it
seems, every life must have bitters mingled with the
sweets; still they were so joyous in that tiny nest!
Why, ah, why was their happiness to be clouded?
Alas, it grieves me even now to tell, though many
long years have since then passed away!</p>

<p>One day the father-bird went from the nest,
and never returned!</p>

<p>Long and patiently waited his little mate,
hoping each moment to hear his welcome note, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
swiftly he winged his way back to her. But the
day wore on, the evening sun grew golden, then
faded in the purple west&mdash;but still he came not!
The other dwellers in the oak returned to their
homes, yet they brought no tidings of the wanderer.
After a while their happy voices were hushed in
sleep, the Blackbird ceased to warble his evening
hymn, and all were buried in slumber, and at rest!</p>

<p>All? Ah, no! the lonely mourner was waking
still, gazing up with sad, sad eyes at the starry
heavens above, asking the night-winds as they
moaned around:</p>

<p>'Will he not return to me?'</p>

<p>Days passed, slowly dragging their length
wearily on for the lonely bird in that desolate
nest. Yet, though her heart was breaking, she
tended her tiny nestlings, neglecting none of her
daily duties; for his dear sake she loved them yet
the more, hoping as each day came it would bring
him back, and striving to imagine his delight when
he returned, and found his young ones almost
fledged. But still the days dawned, the weary
hours went by, the sickness of hope deferred would
fall upon her loving heart, crushing it almost to
breaking; yet bravely she struggled with her woe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
It was when the holy stars shone down, gazing
pityingly at her meekly raised eyes, and she was
alone in stillness with her great sorrow, that then
would she murmur with a bitter cry,&mdash;</p>

<p>'When will he come home to me again?'</p>

<p>Yet still he came not!</p>

<p>Then her brave heart gave way. In vain the
other birds tried to comfort her; she could not
be comforted, for he she so dearly loved 'was not.'</p>

<p>'Do not grieve, do not grieve&mdash;cheer thee,
che-eer thee,' sang the Robin, as he perched beside
her.</p>

<p>Or the Thrush tried to advise, saying, 'Don't
fret, don't fret; 'tis a pity, 'tis a pity!'</p>

<p>But one bright sunny day a Swallow came
flying along. He had just returned from far
distant lands, and all the other birds gathered
chittering around him, eager to hear the news he
had brought. He told them of much he had seen
whilst on the wing; also that he was the pioneer,
his brothers would soon rejoin him, for Summer
was coming; he had heard her heralds in the
fields and groves, had marked her flower-decked
path in forest and in lane. But what was summer
to the heart-broken Wren? There would be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
sunshine for her, since <i>he</i> was not there&mdash;he who
was her all.</p>

<p>'Oh, Swallow,' she timidly asked, 'have you
seen my own love?'</p>

<p>Then the eyes of the Swallow became tear-dimmed,
as sadly he replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Little Jenny Wren, I have!'</p>

<p>'Where&mdash;oh, where?' she cried in thrilling
accents.</p>

<p>He hesitated a few moments, though to her
impatience it seemed hours; he wished to spare
her further agony if he could&mdash;but the truth must
be told.</p>

<p>'Tell me, tell me,' she pleaded, impatient at the
delay.</p>

<p>'In a prison,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'In a prison!' she repeated, horror-struck at
the disclosure; then she added, 'I will go to him,
and share his captivity.'</p>

<p>'Nay, nay,' remonstrated a motherly Sparrow;
'your little ones&mdash;think&mdash;think&mdash;see&mdash;see!'</p>

<p>Sadly she drooped her head upon her breast;
her heart was divided between a mother's duty
and a wife's love.</p>

<p>'I will take care of the nestlings,' said a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Linnet; 'they shall feed with my little ones, I
will shelter them under my wings.'</p>

<p>Gratefully the poor wee bird looked at her
generous friend; words were not needed to express
her thanks.</p>

<p>'Take me to him,' she piteously asked, turning
to the Swallow.</p>

<p>'I shall pass that way to-morrow,' he said, 'for
I must go and meet my comrades, to guide them
here. You can go with me; I will take you to
where he is imprisoned.'</p>

<p>The next morning, before the sun had risen,
away flew the Swallow, and with him the little
Wren. She heeded not that the valleys were still
shrouded in mist, or that the cold grey dawn yet
lingered in the skies; was not her sunshine
coming? should she not soon see him who was
her brightness? The day wore on, and onward
still by the Swallow's side, she, with untiring
pinions, winged her way; she suffered not from
noontide heat, she felt not even the pangs of
hunger or thirst, for her heart was filled with
hope. But towards evening her pitying guide led
her over a hot, murky town; the very sky above
it was hidden by the thick atmosphere of smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which seemed completely to envelope it; the two
birds could scarcely breathe, the air was so dense
with poisonous gases.</p>

<p>'It cannot be here?' she gasped, as suddenly
the Swallow paused in his rapid flight.</p>

<p>'See, see!' was his exclamation.</p>

<p>Then, raising her heavy eyes, she saw, suspended
from a high window, a small wire cage, and in it&mdash;her
long-lost mate!</p>

<p>He was resting on a low perch, with his poor
aching head beneath his wing; his pretty brown
feathers were no longer smoothly plumed, but
hung ragged and tattered around his wasted form,
so different to the bright, bonnie bird of the long-ago!
But she heeded not the change; to her he
was as beautiful, ay, and more dear than ever, so,
flying up, she clung with eager feet to the cruel bars
which kept her from him, and, pressing her beak
as close as possible to the cage, she murmured,&mdash;</p>

<p>'I am here, love!'</p>

<p>At the sound of that sweet voice, so well remembered
by the captive, he raised his drooped
head, and, gazing at her with all the old loving
tenderness, whispered feebly,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Is it you, Jenny? Ah, I knew you would come!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>And every evening found her there. Patiently
would she stay near the prisoner throughout the
dark watches of the night, cheering her loved one
because she was near; but when the grey dawn
came stealing over the skies, away she would fly
back to the nest in the oak, and during the day
would carefully tend her little ones, fulfilling thus
her double duty as wife and mother. Then when
the evening star appeared, telling her of the
gloaming, she would hush her nestlings with a
soothing lullaby, and, when they were sleeping,
would swiftly fly to her imprisoned mate, bearing
in her beak a sprig of moss, or a leaf from the
well-remembered spot where they had been so
happy in the spring-time of their life; and when
she reached the prison, if her loved one was grieving,
pining for the liberty he had lost, the home
ties thus rudely broken, her sweet voice murmuring,
'I am here, love,' seemed to bring comfort to that
poor failing heart; and as she tenderly pressed
her cool, fresh beak to his, so parched and dry, he
would reply, striving to be gay for her dear sake,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Ah, Jenny, you have brought on your wings
some sunlight from our old home, my darling.'</p>

<p>One evening, when as usual she flew to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
prison, she found him lying at the bottom of the
cage, speechless and motionless. Frantically she
tore at the cruel bars, beating them with her wings
in an agony of despair.</p>

<p>'My own love, my own love!' she cried aloud in
her anguish; 'speak to me once again!'</p>

<p>Her beloved voice seemed to possess the power
to recall him back to life, for he heard her, though
the shadows of death were stealing over him.</p>

<p>'Jenny, darling,' he feebly whispered, as she
bent low to catch the faintest word, 'they have
broken my heart. Ah, why did they keep me
thus captive?'</p>

<p>'Oh, do not die!' she moaned; 'think how
lonely I should be in this wide world without you.'</p>

<p>'If I were but free, we should be so happy
again, love,' he said, gasping painfully for breath
as he spoke.</p>

<p>'I will release you,' she cried, and strove with
all her strength to unfasten the prison door, but in
vain&mdash;it resisted all her efforts.</p>

<p>'What shall I do? what shall I do? He will
die, and I cannot help him,' moaned forth the
poor Wren in accents of despair.</p>

<p>'My sweet one,' he murmured, 'do not grieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
so bitterly. Death were better far than life if
separated from you; but, before I close my eyes
for ever upon this world which the good God who
loveth us hath created so beautiful, bring me just
one spray of those little blue flowers.'</p>

<p>'I know them!' she eagerly cried; 'a cluster
grew beneath our nest.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he continued; 'and when I used to return
home I could see them afar off, and would think,
"Jenny is there, and their blue eyes are looking
upon her." Bring me one tiny spray, darling, and
if I die when you are from me, we shall not seem
so very far apart, for those sweet flowers will
whisper to me of you.'</p>

<p>She waited no longer, but flew rapidly away to
bring the blossoms on which he wished to look
once again; but she had not long gone when a
young girl came to the cage, and saw the poor
captive bird as Jenny had found him&mdash;still and
motionless as though dying, and her heart was
filled with tender pity, that its brief life should
thus be so soon ended.</p>

<p>'Poor birdie! I fear it is dying,' she said. 'I
will unfasten the cage; perhaps the fresh air will
revive him, and bring back his failing strength.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>And with kindly hands she opened the prison
door, thus giving him liberty.</p>

<p>The cool, fresh air, stirring his drooping feathers,
aroused him from his lethargy; at first he could
not believe that the door was open, that he was
free. It was almost too much happiness for the
poor sick bird to bear; yet it was true&mdash;freedom
was his, and his first thought was of Jenny.</p>

<p>He would fly to meet her, as he knew she
would soon return, bearing with her the blue
flowers he loved, and then, when she saw <i>him</i>
coming towards her,&mdash;free, yes, free!&mdash;would not
all past sorrow be forgotten in the ever-present
joy? So, with a twitter of gratitude to the girl
who had opened his prison door, he fluttered his
wings, just to try their strength, poised a while
in the air, then away he flew with unerring
instinct towards his dear home in the old oak
tree.</p>

<p>But of Jenny?</p>

<p>With a sad weight upon her poor little heart,
crushing it with the iron grip of despair, she
reached the spot where the flowers grew, plucked
a few blossoms from the stem, then away again,
without pausing to rest, bearing the prized flowerets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in her beak. She felt not fatigue; though her
weary pinions sometimes faltered, still she heeded
it not, still struggling on, eager to reach where he
lay dying. Her only thought was:</p>

<p>'If he were to die, and I not with him.'</p>

<p>But slower and slower grew her flight;
strength at last was failing, for it had been too
severely tried; her breath came quick and fast,
in short, fitful gasps, and her heart beat heavily
beneath her quivering breast.</p>

<p>'Oh, but to see him once more!' she moaned,
as she felt her weary wings failed to do her
bidding. She tried to fly yet a little farther, in
vain; her tired pinions fluttered for a while, then
down she sank, slowly, slowly, on to the calm
bosom of a rippling stream that was flowing on
over its pebbly sands with soothing melody.</p>

<p>'Jenny, Jenny, my own love, where are you?
I have sought you so long, my darling,' she heard
the well-known voice exclaiming.</p>

<p>She raised her dying eyes, and saw her loved
mate hovering above her in the summer air.</p>

<p>'I am here, love,' she faintly murmured.</p>

<p>Then with all the old love-light beaming from
her soft, gentle eyes, she turned to gaze at her poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
desolate mate, who was rending the air with his
piteous cries, then closed them for ever, with a
look of perfect peace, murmuring softly,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Dearest, forget me not.'</p>

<p>And the rippling stream bore her gently away
echoing with a plaintive wail her dying words:</p>

<p>'Dearest, forget me not.'</p>

<p>The poor widowed bird caught the flowers as
they were floating away on the breast of his lost
love, and carried them to his now desolate home;
but one little blossom, in tender pity for sweet
Jenny Wren, detached itself from the others to
linger still with the poor dead bird; and when the
stream had carefully borne its precious burden to
a shady nook, where she could rest, for ever freed
from sorrow and pain, the flower was carried with
her, and, taking root above the spot where she lay
buried, put forth its blue blossoms in loving
remembrance of that fond, faithful heart.</p>

<p>And thus it is how we became dwellers close

<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_dropm.png" width="123" height="182" alt="M" style="margin-top: -1em;" /></span><span class="upper">y</span> life has been so tranquil, that I fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
it will not possess much interest;
for, when first recollection dawned, I
remember finding myself far down in the
earth&mdash;a small bulb, not much to look at,
I am thinking. But very happy were the days
spent there with my companions. We in our
ignorance deemed the world a dreary place, and
wished we could for ever stay where it was so cosy
and warm; but our Mother Earth was carefully
instructing us, teaching us the same precious
lessons she unfolds to her other children, if they
will but read the ever-open book, by man called
'Nature.'</p>

<p>I know not how long it was that the Frost King
kept the land bound captive in icy chains, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
at last the signal for freedom came. The trees
awoke from their winter sleep, and, casting off their
sombre garments of sheathed leaves, came forth in
vestments of tender green; the bees, too, sent out
their pioneers, who hastened back to the hives with
the glad tidings of the sunshine and of awakening
flowers. The birds flew hither and thither on
joyous wings, twittering their simple gratitude to
Him who 'heareth the ravens cry;' for they indeed
were thankful that the dark days were past, and
that 'the time of the singing of birds had come.'
As to the little brooks and streams, how rejoiced
were they to be free once more! they bounded
away over the sandy shallows or pebbly beds,
laughing for very gladness, and kissing the green
banks whose fresh verdure they laved, whilst
murmuring to them their gladsome song:</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">'I'm free! oh, joy! I am free once again!</span><br />
<span class="i2">I have burst with delight my icy chain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And gaily I flow to the open sea,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Joyously singing, I'm free! oh, I'm free!</span><br />
<br />
<span class="i0">I kiss the green banks as I glide along,</span><br />
<span class="i2">I woo the birds with my peaceful song;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The sunbeams they dance to my joyous strain,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Whilst gaily I fling their rays back again.'</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>And for us also came the appointed time, when
we too had to leave the home in which we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
been so tenderly nurtured; we were to go, ready
prepared to do the work marked out for us.</p>

<p>But I did not wish to go; I feared to face a
world unknown to me, and fain would have
lingered in the home so loved.</p>

<p>'Why must I leave you?' I asked of our
gentle parent. 'I cannot bear the separation.'</p>

<p>'My child,' she replied, with something of
reproach in her soft voice, 'have you so soon
forgotten the lesson I taught you, that He who
created all things, createth nothing in vain? Go
forth upon the earth, and speak in parables of His
glorious works.'</p>

<p>'What can I teach?&mdash;I, so small, and of no
repute!' I asked, still doubting.</p>

<p>'Some lesson of His goodness to the children
of men,' was her reply.</p>

<p>'But everything on earth appears to have its
appointed mission; there seems no work for me,'
I urged in excuse.</p>

<p>'God will find something for even you to do,'
she said; 'it may be only a message from Him.'</p>

<p>'A message!' I repeated. 'What could I say
to others? Already have all the flowers their
symbols: the Violet is the Hope flower, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Heart's-ease speaks of Thought; what can we
Snowdrops tell?'</p>

<p>Our mother did not answer&mdash;she left us to find
what lessons we best could teach.</p>

<p>So day by day we grew, stronger and stronger,
gradually becoming better fitted to perform the
work allotted; until at last I appeared above the
ground&mdash;a slender green leaf!</p>

<p>Never shall I forget how cheerless looked the
earth when first I came above it, so dull and
black, save where a few snowflakes had been
drifted by the wintry winds; all else was bleak
and bare. There was not a gleam of sunshine
athwart the leaden sky to cheer us, nor a bird to
meet us with a friendly greeting, for even the
robins kept so near the houses for warmth and
shelter, they came not to the spot where we grew,
alone and sad; and as to the trees, they as yet
stood silent above us, only the Holly was still
decked with gay scarlet berries, enlivening up the
gloomy landscape with a little bright colour.
But the Holly smiled not on us; armed at all
points in his glossy coat of shining mail, he
was so lofty and grand, and we were only&mdash;Snowdrops!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>But I grew on, cherished by our great
Mother Nature, who careth for all her children,
and loves them tenderly, be they humble Daisies
or the queenly Rose; and at last I became a
perfect flower, taking my pure white tints from
the snow around me, and borrowing just a faint
tinge of green from the young grass that was now
bravely struggling to appear.</p>

<p>By and by, a Blackbird, with golden beak and
shining coat, found me out as he was seeking a
convenient tree in which to make a nest, and,
bowing politely, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Welcome to you, fair Snowdrop! I am
rejoiced to see you, for you bring us the assurance
that spring is on the way, and we shall be glad,
for the winter has been long and dreary.'</p>

<p>Then he having communicated the glad tidings
to the other birds, they also came to greet me,
cheering my loneliness with their sweet songs.
Yet still I pined to return to earth again; I cared
not to look upward, but hung my head, murmuring
sadly,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, Mother Earth, take home thy child! she is
so weary of her life here.'</p>

<p>Was I wrong? Perhaps so, but I owed my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
existence to that which mortals deem so cold and
dark; I loved it with the affection of a loving
child, and longed to rest again upon the dear
bosom that had sheltered me when I was but a
frail bulb.</p>

<p>Besides, it seemed to me that I was doing no
good. Why was I sent here, if only to bloom and
then die? I had been told that nothing was
created in vain; was I doing the work for which I
had been sent upon the earth?</p>

<p>Whilst thus repining over my useless life, a
poet passed by chance&mdash;stay, was it chance? nay,
there is no chance! He was one who as yet had
met with but little success; I am told there are
many such among earth's children. We know
that it is said:</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
'Many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />
And waste its sweetness on the desert air;'<br />
</div></div>

<p>yet the sweetness is not <i>lost</i>, for it speaks
with a perfumed voice to the creatures of
the air; but among mortals, many fade away
into utter oblivion, breathing only their sad,
sweet heart-songs to the listening winds
around.</p>

<p>And this poet of whom I speak, he felt within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
himself the inspiration of genius, that innate love
of the beautiful and true which comes from God
alone; but the world looked coldly on him, and
he was struggling with what seemed endless
disappointments, battling with them bravely, yet
almost sinking amidst the strife. His very heart
was beginning to fail him, his noble courage to
give way, when he saw me there, blossoming alone
in that quiet nook.</p>

<p>'Oh, God!' he cried, as, with clasped hands
and eyes raised heavenward, he sank beside me on
the sod,&mdash;'oh, God, forgive me that I should dare
to doubt Thy loving care, when this fragile, fragile
flower, sheltered by Thee, has braved the wintry
storms, while the cold winds pass tenderly over
its bowed head. A bruised reed Thou wilt not
break; Thou carest for the lilies of the field,&mdash;why
then should I fear when adversity assails me?
Art Thou not still above, though heaven seems so
far off, and oh, so cold and pitiless! I will
have faith in Thy divine and fatherly love, and
accept the lesson this sweet flower hath taught
me.'</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Yes, faith&mdash;faith in God, was the parable I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sent to teach, and I also have learned to know
that, though the skies may be dark and the winds&mdash;oh,
so cold! yet if we only wait, and trust
Him, the sunshine will come at last, and the
breath of heaven never visit us too roughly.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE FOXGLOVES' STRATAGEM&mdash;GRATITUDE.</h3>


<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_dropw.png" width="143" height="190" alt="W" style="margin-top: -1em;" /></span><span class="upper">e</span> lived on the garden wall of an old-farmhouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
over which the vines
grew in rare luxuriance, covering it
with their climbing tendrils and leaves;
and in the autumn the purple and white
grapes peeped from beneath their leafy shelter,
mocking the thirsty throats of the village lads
who passed that way, and who looked longingly
up at the ripe clusters.</p>

<p>It was a very old place, I am told, and had
been inhabited by the same family for many
successive generations. Fathers had tilled the
soil, then laid aside the plough for ever. Sons
had sprung up to take their place, and they too,
in their turn, were gathered in, when the bearded
grain was ripe for the sickle of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
'Reaper, whose name is Death,' leaving the old
homestead to others of the same name and race,
who loved the home in which they were born,
and wherein those they most cherished had lived
and died.</p>

<p>The Swallows, too, loved it, returning year after
year to their nests under the eaves, and from
early dawn 'to dewy eve,' all through the warm
summer days, flew hither and thither with swift,
untiring wing, chasing each other, as it were, or
teaching their young to fly. As to the Robins,
they hopped in at the open door under the rustic
porch, just as if they belonged to the place, and
were sure of a welcome, which indeed they were!
And that porch&mdash;what a cosy corner it was, with
seats on either side, inviting weary feet to rest!
the sunbeams were always playing bo-peep through
the leaves which hung clustering around; the
Honeysuckles and Clematis decking it, too, with
their blossoms, scattering their delicious perfume
the while. But I always thought the spot looked
brightest when little Susie was there&mdash;she who was
the very sunshine of the old home! And how
they all loved her, from the white-headed grandfather
down to the little ploughboy, who brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
her all the poor motherless or sick creatures he
found on the farm, were it but a half-fledged bird
or a stray kitten, certain of her thanks, and a
sweet smile; and as to her three big brothers,
who had such influence over them as little Susie?
for even when they were disputing as to whose
turn it was to ride Brown Bess (the joint property
of the children), Susie was always chosen umpire
to decide the important question, and they abode
by her decision.</p>

<p>Why, it was Susie who saved us from being
ruthlessly destroyed! for it happened that one
day old Peter was at work in the garden, and, to
make the place 'a bit more tidy,' as he said, was
proceeding to cut us off from the wall.</p>

<p>'They bain't o' much account,' he muttered,
sharpening his hook; 'not loike them there
Roses maister sets sich store by, and thinks so
much on.'</p>

<p>Certainly it seemed very sad that, because we
were merely 'common flowers,' our lives were to
be cut short long before the appointed time; we
had endeavoured to bloom as brightly as our more
refined sisters, and in sunshine or shower had
tried our best to look gay, and, I think, had suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>ceeded,
for we do not shut our petals as if we
were sulking when dark clouds come, but keep
them always open. But the fiat had gone forth&mdash;old
Peter was the stern arbitrator of our destinies!
and, feeling that our fate was inevitable, we sighed
a last long farewell to each other, just as we saw
him raise his sharp hook to cut us down. At
that moment, so 'big with fate' for us, who
should come into the garden, singing for very
gladness like the birds themselves, but little Susie;
the sunlight was playing with her waving hair,
her eyes sparkled as the dewdrops in the sun,
and her tiny feet skipped lightly along as she
came dancing up the pathway.</p>

<p>That prolonged our lives! Old Peter dropped his
hook to turn round and look at his young mistress.</p>

<p>'What are you going to do, Peter?' she inquired,
as she drew near, and saw him take up his tools
to resume work.</p>

<p>'Whoy, lop doun these 'ere things, Miss Zusie,'
he replied, pointing at us contemptuously.</p>

<p>'Oh, please don't destroy them! they are so
pretty!' was her eager exclamation.</p>

<p>'Purty, missie!' the old man repeated, with
astonishment; 'whoy, them be wild loike.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>'But I love them dearly,' she persisted; 'so
please leave them there.'</p>

<p>'But the maister?' pursued Peter, rubbing his
rough head in his perplexity; 'he told me to clear
roight up.'</p>

<p>Peter, it must be observed, was 'the odd man'
about the farm; there is always one.</p>

<p>'Father will say you did quite right to let
them live,' replied the little lady; 'he likes them
as much as I do, for he says he remembers
them always growing here, coming up year
after year without troubling any one to look
after them, and making the old wall a very flower-garden.'</p>

<p>'Well, Miss Zusie, if so be ye sez so, I s'pose
I must,' he acquiesced, though I think he was
greatly disappointed that he could not have his
own way about it; so there we were left, and we
bloomed more than ever, striving to do our best in
gratitude to the little maiden.</p>

<p>Now, I have noticed, as a rule,&mdash;mind, every rule
has exceptions,&mdash;that good deeds, like good seed,
seldom fall to the ground and wither away. Both
may lie fallow, for a while at least, but the flower
comes up after a while, and 'with what measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
ye mete, it is meted to you again.' You may not
have remarked this, perhaps, but the fact holds
good, proving most emphatically the sacred truth,
'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain
mercy.'</p>

<p>Now, when Susie saved our lives, she never
thought that simple flowers could ever repay her
kindness, and for some time, it is true, we did
nothing, only strove to make the garden wall look
gay with our sturdy buds and blossoms.</p>

<p>But one day, I remember, Susie sat on the
lawn close by the wall on which we grew, very
busy making a smart new dress for her doll, Miss
Arabella, who sat propped up by a work-box at
her back, with her arms straight out, and her toes
turned in, but with a sweet smile upon her waxen
face. They were evidently engaged in earnest
conversation, for Susie kept speaking in her own
voice for herself, and using a very shrill falsetto
for Arabella, who, by the bye, appeared to reply
only in monosyllables.</p>

<p>In the midst of this very entertaining discourse
I heard another voice exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Look 'ee 'ere, Miss Zusie, this vowl 'ave airt
her vut;' and the small ploughboy I before men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>tioned
came in at the garden gate, holding a hen
in his arms.</p>

<p>'Oh, give it to me, Joey,' cried the little girl,
full of sympathy for the wounded bird. 'How did
it happen? Poor dear, poor dear!'</p>

<p>With that Joey poured forth a long account of
the accident, to which she listened attentively, all
the while soothing the lamed hen, and wrapping
it up in her soft frock.</p>

<p>'I will bathe its poor foot in warm water, and
try to get it well,' she said, after thanking Joey
for bringing it to her; and she went into the
house, leaving Arabella alone on the lawn,
cautioning her, however, 'to be a good child
until mamma returned.'</p>

<p>It was some days before we again saw the hen,
and then she was quite restored, and had been
given to Susie as her 'very own' because of the
care she had bestowed upon her; indeed, she had
become quite a pet, actually was allowed to roam
about the flower-garden and lawns; and some
one had given her the name of 'Zenobia,'&mdash;an inconvenient
name to call when in a hurry, but
Susie was very satisfied with it, and so, I suppose,
was the hen, who seemed to love her little mistress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
following her wherever she went, eating from her
hand, and even perching on her shoulder! After
some time Zenobia was to be seen walking
about, followed by a family of nine chickens; and
really I cannot tell which was most proud of the
young brood, Susie or the hen. Susie called
them 'loves' and 'beauties,' and the hen, she
clucked, and made a great fuss over them, and, as
if determined that their bed should be of roses,
insisted on roosting every night under a rose-bush
which grew near the garden gate, instead
of the cosy coop with which she had been
provided.</p>

<p>Well, one moonlight night we, of course, were
awake, though the church clock had long since
struck the hour of midnight; and it was so still,
only the voices of the night murmuring among the
trees, though occasionally we could hear the soft
crooning of the hen, as she hushed her little family
to sleep beneath the rose-bush. Suddenly we
heard the sound of stealthy footsteps creeping
under the wall.</p>

<p>'It is only Dash, the house dog,' whispered a
sister-flower, who grew on the same stem as
myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>'Dash does not steal along in that crafty manner,'
said another.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it is a rabbit,' suggested one, 'or a cat
taking a walk.'</p>

<p>'It may be a rat.'</p>

<p>Various conjectures were hazarded by those who
grew low down on the wall, but I was higher up
than they, so, looking cautiously over, what should
I see but a Fox creeping along, and scenting his
prey, with his sharp nose close to the ground.</p>

<p>'Good evening!' I called out to him.</p>

<p>He started with alarm, for great rascals are
always great cowards.</p>

<p>'Oh, good evening, my friend,' he replied, very
blandly. 'Charming evening this for a walk.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered sharply; 'but rather late for
respectable folks to be abroad!'</p>

<p>'Ah yes, just so,' was his response; 'but, you
see, my doctor has advised me to take quiet
rambles.'</p>

<p>'It was not Dr. Quack, was it?' I asked;
'because, poor fellow, he came to an untimely end
the other night,&mdash;had his head bitten off, and his
body was then dragged across the yard, as I
suppose you already know?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>'Dear me!' he ejaculated, with affected pity, and
glancing slyly up at me out of the corner of his
red eyes; 'but how should I know, my friend?'</p>

<p>'Oh, because some of your family are strongly
suspected,' was my reply; 'indeed, our Dash is on
the watch, so I would advise you to'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Good-night, good-night,' he hurriedly exclaimed.
'I feel the winds are becoming very chilly.'</p>

<p>So saying, he shuffled off as fast as possible,
more especially as at that moment Dash began
barking furiously, as though he scented a foe.
How we laughed to think we had frightened the
artful fellow away, and some of us thought we
should never see him again; but we were mistaken,
for, a few nights after, there he was creeping along
so stealthily outside the garden wall.</p>

<p>'What do you want?' I called out to him.</p>

<p>'Nothing, my friend, nothing,' was his answer.</p>

<p>'Well, since we do not keep that article here,
you had better seek it elsewhere,' interposed a
brother of mine who is rather saucy.</p>

<p>The Fox paused for a moment, as if hesitating
what to say; at length he began, in a whining tone
of voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>'My beloved friends, I perceive I must take you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
into my confidence. The fact is, my worthy
doctor says I am in delicate health, and has therefore
directed me'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, seeing that he hesitated; 'what
of that?'</p>

<p>'Simply this; he has ordered me to eat only light,
digestible food, such as chicken,' he went on to say.</p>

<p>'Oh, has he?' I remarked; and then I thought
to myself, 'Now can your craftiness be seen
through: you are after Zenobia; but Susie saved
our lives, she shall not find the poor despised Fox-gloves
ungrateful. We will save Zenobia!'</p>

<p>However, Mr. Reynard had not guessed our
thoughts (for we all thought alike on the subject),
but continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now, charming friends, I know you have a
most delightful hen in this garden.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, and nine such plump chickens!' cried
my brother.</p>

<p>'Oh dear, how very nice!' exclaimed the Fox.</p>

<p>'And I have no doubt,' continued my brother,
whilst we could hardly restrain our mirth, 'but
that Zenobia would willingly give them up to you,
for the honour of being devoured by so distinguished
a personage.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>'Would she really?' he cried, swallowing this
piece of flattery as greedily as he would the
chickens.</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' I chimed in; 'but there's one thing
I would mention. Grandees like you must be
formally introduced. Zenobia would be horrified
were you to appear before her so unceremoniously;
she might even refuse your request for one of the
chickens.'</p>

<p>'What shall I do, then?' he eagerly questioned.</p>

<p>'Why, dress yourself of course, appear <i>en
grande toilette</i>,' I replied; 'brush up your whiskers
a little more, make your coat look glossy, and,
above all, put on a pair of gloves!'</p>

<p>'Gloves!' he repeated. 'I have not a single pair;
tell me where I can purchase them?'</p>

<p>'Leave that to us,' said my brother, bursting
with glee. 'Originally, you must know, we were
Fox-glovers, but somehow we have lost our ancient
privilege; therefore have the supreme graciousness
to restore it to us, and we will be only too proud
to serve you.'</p>

<p>'Oh, certainly,' assented the Fox, assuming at
once an air of patronage that was highly amusing.
'I take six and three-quarters,' extending his forepad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>'No, surely not!' protested my merry brother;
'you must be mistaken; such a pretty little paw
as yours cannot possibly require such a large glove.
Allow me to suggest six and a quarter.'</p>

<p>The Fox agreed to the size named.</p>

<p>'If you will condescend to call here to-morrow
night about this time, they shall be ready for you,'
one of us declared.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' he said loftily, as though he was
conferring a favour upon us, and off he went, no
doubt congratulating himself on his diplomacy. As
to us, we laughed heartily, knowing how the crafty
old fellow would be caught in his own toils.</p>

<p>The next day, when we saw Susie feeding and
caressing Zenobia, how we longed for the power
to tell her of the danger that so fearfully menaced
her pet, but we could not; for, though there is a
'language of flowers,' it does not discourse on such
a topic as this, therefore we were compelled to
keep silence; but we were determined to do our
best to guard little Susie's treasure. Night came,
and dark and dreary it was too, with heavy clouds
drifting across the moon, almost hiding its brightness;
and it grew so late, past twelve, we began
to think Mr. Reynard suspected us, and would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
come. But he did, looking so sleek and shiny,
with his coat all spick and span, being freshly
brushed, I expect.</p>

<p>'Here I am, my friends; it has taken me so long
to dress,' he said, panting with the haste he had
evidently made. 'Is Zenobia&mdash;what a sweet name,
to be sure!' he added in a fawning voice,&mdash;'is she
here?'</p>

<p>'Of course she is,' I replied; 'can you not hear
her crooning to her <i>nine</i> children?' with a strong
emphasis on the number.</p>

<p>'Sweet, tender creature!' he exclaimed. 'Oh,
but to know her yet more intimately! Let me
jump over the gate to her!'</p>

<p>'What! without your gloves on?' cried several
of us at once; 'consider how very vulgar you
would look.'</p>

<p>'Dear, dear, I quite forgot,' he ejaculated rather
impatiently; evidently he wanted his supper.</p>

<p>'Here they are,' said my brother; 'pray allow
me the honour of putting them on for you.'</p>

<p>He saw the fox was all impatience; however,
he was obliged to consent, and my brother proceeded
forthwith to fit on a pair of Fox-gloves
made expressly by us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>'They are rather a tight fit,' he nervously
remarked.</p>

<p>'Rather,' we cried, as my brother held him fast
by the paws, and we went to assist him in keeping
the scoundrel a prisoner.</p>

<p>He saw, when too late, the trap into which he
had fallen, and struggled hard to get free, even
trying to pull us from off the old wall in his
futile efforts to escape. But we were too securely
fixed there for his strength to be of any avail; our
roots were the growth of years, and, besides, we
clasped him so tightly&mdash;for unity is indeed strength&mdash;that
at last the cowardly fellow roared aloud
with mingled pain and fright; perhaps he thought
to startle us, and make us lose our hold. But we
knew better than that&mdash;<i>we</i> only gripped him the
faster; but the noise aroused Dash, who came
bounding to the spot (he was always unchained at
night), and, flying at Mr. Reynard's throat, he soon
pinned him to the ground.</p>

<p>The farmer and his sons must have heard the
cries of the Fox and the baying of Dash, for
presently they came running as fast as possible to
the spot, armed with all sorts of weapons, and soon
despatched the rascal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>And it would have pleased you to have heard
the praises bestowed upon the brave old dog for
his courage, which praise he most certainly
deserved; but no one thought of us. However, we
had our reward in feeling that we had done our
duty, and tried to repay our debt of gratitude to
little Susie; that was recompense enough for us,
nor did we wish for more, for&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE LITTLE MINER AND HIS FLOWER&mdash;TRUST IN GOD.</h3>


<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_dropi.png" width="123" height="175" alt="I" style="margin-top: -1em;" /></span> <span class="upper">do</span> not think any of us would care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to pass the greater part of our days
down in a coal mine, or even to live
in the vicinity of one. For miles around
the country is barren of trees or flowers;
even the grass does not grow there; the very air
is dense with black smoke from the numerous
chimneys, so that the sky is hidden, as it were,
by a thick, murky veil. But, if thus dreary by
day, how much more dreadful does it look at
night, when the lurid glare from the furnaces
lights up the sky with a red gleam, which can be
seen far and wide! it has then in it something
terrible.</p>

<p>As I said just now, not a flower can thrive in
such a close and heavy atmosphere; not even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
blade of grass can push its way up through the
coal-encrusted soil which covers the earth. Well
may it be called the 'Black Country;' and yet
there are brave, good men living, ay, and working
there, day after day descending those dark shafts
and in the underground of the mines living out
their hard, laborious lives, braving dangers innumerable,
to provide for the wants of their fellow-men;
yet I wonder how many of us, as we gather
round the cosy fireside of home, ever think of the
hardy miners. All honour, then, to that Christian
man, whose noble heart thought so much of them
and of the risks they encounter in the deep mines;
his mighty genius studied to avert the dangers
to which they are exposed, and by his clever invention
many thousand lives have been saved.
Statues are raised to soldiers and statesmen, and
their deeds are chronicled all over the world, yet
the simple-hearted Cornish chemist has done more
for England's glory than all her greatest warriors
or statesmen!</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is true, terrible accidents happen
even now, and indeed, had any one passed through
a certain coal district on the day of which we
speak, a scene of desolation and misery would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
have presented itself; for there had been a colliery
accident!&mdash;a fearful explosion in a mine through
some (as yet) unknown cause, and they were now
bringing up the dead and dying. We too often,
alas! read these sad accounts in the newspapers,
but cannot fully realize the intense anguish and
despair among the mining population when such
a calamity befalls them. Try to picture, then, the
men, women, and even children, who were gathered
in anxious groups around the mouth of the pit,
eagerly waiting to see if any of their kindred were
among the hapless victims; and when the brave
rescue party would appear above the shaft, bearing
in their arms the sufferers, wailing cries would
rend the very air, as some poor woman recognised
her son or her 'good man' in the crushed and
mangled form they laid so tenderly down!</p>

<p>There was a little cottage standing among others
of the same class, but which from its appearance
seemed to betoken the residence of one more refined
than the rest, for snowy curtains draped the
windows, the panes of which were scrupulously
clean, and the doorsteps were as white as hands
could make them. Going now towards this
cottage, a group of men might be seen, carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
carrying a heavy burden, over which a sheet was
spread. It was their foreman&mdash;a man loved and
respected by them all, and the hearts of these
rough colliers beat sadly, as they bore him thus
towards his once happy home!</p>

<p>The rumour of the catastrophe, and of her
husband being one among the many poor sufferers,
had burst upon his wife like the surging of an
angry wave, overwhelming her with its force, and
she sat with ashen cheeks and quivering lips,
listening with bated breath for that which she
knew must come, the while convulsively clasping
in her arms their only child, their fair-haired
Davie. But when at last she heard the measured
tread of those who bore him coming nearer and
nearer to her door, she rose, with a shivering sob,
to meet him, as she had ever done, with a loving
smile, though now her heart was full of anguish.
And he knew her, for he put out his poor
crushed hand for her to take, faintly murmuring,&mdash;</p>

<p>'My poor, poor girl!'</p>

<p>Tenderly, as with the gentle touch of woman,
those rugged men laid him upon the bed from
which he had risen in full health and strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and the wife's hand was firm, as softly she removed
the garments from his mangled limbs. Ah, little
had she thought, when she bade him 'Good-bye'
that morning, his return would have been thus.
He had said to Davie in his merry way, laying his
hand on the boy's curly head,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Ah, young man, soon you will be the bread-winner;
your old father will then be able to sit
idle by the ingle and smoke his pipe, whilst mother
looks on.'</p>

<p>He had returned to the ingle, but Davie was
still a child!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>A few anxious days, and all was over; the end
had come, and he and his fellow-sufferers were
laid to rest beneath the fresh green turf in a
distant churchyard, and the poor young widow
was alone in the wide world, with only little
Davie!</p>

<p>But the poor have no time to spare for mourning
or regrets; they must be up and doing, even
though their hearts fail them for very sorrow; yet
none save those who have suffered can know the
utter desolation of heart, crushing the very soul
to the earth with despair, when the father, 'the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
bread-winner,' is taken from their midst, and those
who are left know not where to look for help or
guidance; and so this poor widow sat by the fire-light,
with her boy's hand clasped in hers, gazing
into the glowing embers as if trying to read the
future therein. The past had been very happy,
for her girlhood was spent in a far different sphere,
but she had freely given up all for him who was
now no more, and had never repented of the sacrifice
made; but, alas! he was gone, leaving her
alone, and her heart was like to break. And,
musing thus, she recalled the tones of the dear
voice that had ever comforted her when in sadness,
now silent for ever!&mdash;the brave heart
so firm of purpose that had ceased to beat!&mdash;and
as she thought of him who had been so kind, so
true, her courage gave way, and, burying her face
in her hands, she sobbed aloud, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, Davie, Davie! who will care for us now
father is gone?'</p>

<p>The child put his arms lovingly around her
bowed head, as though it was his place to be
the comforter.</p>

<p>'Mother darling, the Lord will care for us. He
is the friend of the widow and fatherless.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>There was something in the boy's voice that
struck the mother's ear, for she removed her hands
from before her face, and, drawing him nearer to
her, gazed earnestly into those clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>Sudden sorrow often changes the entire nature
of people, and the events of the last few days had,
as it were, transformed little Davie from a mere
child into a thoughtful boy. Like his namesake
of old, 'he was of a beautiful countenance,' and as
he caressingly smoothed his mother's pale cheeks
with his soft, gentle hands, she felt she was not
desolate, since he was left to her. Long they sat
in silence. At last the boy said,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Mother dear, Mat Morgan says that, as I am
now ten years old, it is time for me to begin work
like the other lads about here.'</p>

<p>'How, Davie?' she dreamily questioned, for her
thoughts were wandering far away, so that she
scarcely heard what he said.</p>

<p>'In the pit with him,' was the reply; 'he is so
kind and good, I know he will take great care
of me.'</p>

<p>'No, no!' she cried, clasping him yet closer to
her; 'not in the cruel mine that has robbed us of
father!&mdash;no&mdash;not there!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>'Nay, mother darling,' the boy gently urged;
'it was God who took father home&mdash;and he was
ready to go! Besides,' he continued, with all the
hopefulness of youth, 'I could earn some money
every week, and only think how useful that
would be!'</p>

<p>'But your poor father did not wish you to be
a miner; he hoped you would become a great and
clever man,' the mother replied.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment. Bright visions
had filled his young head of gaining riches and
honours 'some day,' that glorious time of the
young, and he had thought how proud they both
would be of him, and they should neither of them
work any more, but live in a lovely home of <i>his</i>
providing, and never know care any more. And
now!&mdash;he clenched his small hands together, and
choked back the big lump rising in his throat as
bravely he exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>'And I will be a clever man, for I will learn
at night when I come home, and who knows
what I may be one day. Mat Morgan says our
manager was only a poor collier lad once, and
look at him now. Besides, they are all so good
to us here; they loved father dearly.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>So the boy prevailed over her fears, and in a
few days he took his place by the side of his old
friend Mat Morgan, who grew to love him as his
own child. But the mother's heart was grieved
when at night her boy returned with the fair
golden hair rough and tangled, the once delicate
hands torn and hardening with toil; yet the
child gave no thought to that. True, this was
not the life he would have chosen, for he was a
studious boy, but still, was he not 'the bread-winner'?
and it was a proudly happy day for him
when he laid his first earnings in her lap, and felt
her tears upon his cheek as she kissed and
blessed her boy.</p>

<p>But the hour he loved the best was when,
casting aside all care, he sat on a low stool at her
feet, and, with his head resting on her knee,
listened as she read aloud their evening chapter
from the Book of Life; he was then the child
again, not the toiling little miner-lad!&mdash;and oh,
it was so peaceful!</p>

<p>'"Consider the lilies of the field, they toil not,
neither do they spin,"' read the mother one evening.</p>

<p>'But, mother, what are lilies like? I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
never seen one, you know,' asked the boy, when
she had ceased reading and had closed the book.</p>

<p>In simple language, she endeavoured to describe
to her town-born child the exquisite beauties of
the flowers of the field, and he, with an innate
love of the beautiful, caught readily at all she
said, and seemed as though he saw them all as
she depicted.</p>

<p>'How I should love to be where there are
always flowers!' he exclaimed; 'it must be like
paradise! But those I have seen always close
up at night. I wish there was one here that
opened of an evening, as if to greet me when I
come home!'</p>

<p>I know not how it happened, but the next
night, when little Davie entered his home, a
delicious perfume filled the air, and standing in
the cottage window was an Evening Primrose,
with its petals fully expanded.</p>

<p>'Mother, mother,' cried the boy, 'my wish
has come true! here is a flower opening its
blossoms to bid me welcome home;' and in excess
of delight he knelt and kissed his treasure again
and again. And words cannot express the love
he bestowed upon the plant; it was to him an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
unfeigned joy to watch the growing of each leaf,
the gradual unfolding of each fresh bud; and
every night, on his return from work, his first
thought, after the thought for his mother, was of
his sweet Evening Primrose.</p>

<p>Those who gather flowers at will, prize them
for a while, then cast them carelessly aside, can
form no idea of the all-absorbing love the little
miner lad evinced for his one fair flower; it was
his sole treasure, and he ever watched and tended
it lovingly and well.</p>

<p>But time passed on, and it was Davie's last
day in the coal-mine. He was going to exchange
that toilsome life, so uncongenial to his taste, but
which stern necessity had made him adopt, for a
new and brighter occupation, one, too, for which
he had always ardently longed. The manager of
whom he had spoken to his mother had frequently
noticed the gentle, fair-haired boy; prosperity had
not hardened <i>his</i> heart (as it so often does), and
recollections of the long-ago flashed ever across
him, when he saw Davie bravely striving to do
his best to help his mother bear her burden of
sorrowful poverty. He too had been a collier lad
in those far-off days, and 'the only son of <i>his</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
mother, and she was a widow.' The grass was
green above that dear mother's grave, whose latter
years had been cheered and comforted by his
tender, fostering love; but his thoughts were of
her, as, laying his hand upon the lad's curly head,
he kindly asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Would you like to leave the pit-work, David,
and go into the engineers' department?'</p>

<p>'What! and become a great man like Stephenson
and Brunel? Oh yes, sir!' the boy joyfully
exclaimed, for, like all youthful ambitions
he vaulted at once to the highest pinnacle of
greatness&mdash;there is no midway for the ardent
young.</p>

<p>The manager smiled at his enthusiasm, as he
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>'You can but try, my lad, to be as great and
good as they were;' and he added, 'You can enter
upon your new work next week; there is a vacancy
for you.'</p>

<p>'But, sir,'&mdash;and the boy paused,&mdash;'shall I earn
wages like I do now? because'&mdash;</p>

<p>And his voice failed him, he could not utter
the thought of his heart,&mdash;should he still be able to
help his mother?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentleman understood his hesitation, for he
said kindly,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, my little man, you will earn good wages,
and, if you are only good and steady like your
poor father before you, I've no doubt but that
you may become a great man one day;' and he
smiled encouragingly into the boy's upturned face,
a face which was beaming with hope and happiness.</p>

<p>As to Davie, he raised his generous friend's
hand to his lips, for he could not speak for very
gratitude; then, with his blue eyes sparkling
with joy, ran quickly home to tell the blissful
news.</p>

<p>'Mother, mother!' he cried, bursting in upon
her as she sat at work; 'I <i>shall</i> become a great
man now, and you shall ride in a carriage, and
never work any more;' and then, with his arms
around her neck and his curly head resting lovingly
upon her shoulder, he poured forth his bright
hopes for the future.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>So the last day came for working in the dark
mine, and to-morrow&mdash;oh, to-morrow!</p>

<p>'But I'll miss ye, Davie,' Mat Morgan observed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
as he and his little friend trudged on side by
side to work; 'ye be bright and cheery-like down
there,' pointing with his pipe towards the pit.
'And maybe ye'll forget the missis and me when
ye gets to be a great man, as ye says ye'll be one
day, and I makes no doubt but ye will be too.
Ye be summat like yer poor fayther, my lad; he
were allers above we.'</p>

<p>'Nay, Master Morgan!' cried the boy reproachfully;
'were you not my first friend, when dear
father died? You don't mean that, I know!
looking up at his old friend's rugged face with
eyes full of tears. Then, brushing them away
with his jacket sleeve,&mdash;it was not manly to cry,
he thought,&mdash;he continued, 'No, when I am rich,
you and Mrs. Morgan shall both live in a big
house with mother and me; we will ride in a
grand carriage, and be so happy all together,
and never look at black coals except to burn
them.'</p>

<p>The old miner smiled as he listened to the
boy's bright day-dreams, yet still he could not
help feeling somewhat sad, for he dearly loved
the lad, and knew how much he should miss
his merry chatter and song, which so beguiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the time while they worked together down in the
mine.</p>

<p>But the time passed on much as on other days;
when, just as they were preparing to leave off
work, and another gang was coming to relieve
them, a low, rumbling sound was heard. One or
two of the men ran to the entrance of the working,
Mat Morgan among the number, and his
face was blanched when he returned to his comrades.</p>

<p>'What is it, Master Morgan?' asked Davie,
looking up at him with an undefined dread.</p>

<p>'My lad,' was his reply, and his voice was very
calm, 'there has been a landslip in the sidings,
and we are shut in.'</p>

<p>'But can we not get out?' he questioned.</p>

<p>'No, never again, unless help comes,' he
hoarsely whispered, for his brave heart stood
still at the terrible danger they were in.</p>

<p>Indeed, no pen can express the terror that filled
the hearts of these brave and hardy men at the
thought of being thus entombed in a living
grave; they quailed not when meeting death face
to face, but shrank in dread at the slowly advancing
foe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>All but the boy!</p>

<p>The light from the flickering lamps the miners
carried fell upon his delicate features; but his
eyes brightly gleamed, as, laying his hands on the
bowed head of his old friend, he softly said,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Master Morgan, let us not fear; our God is
with us still!'</p>

<p>'Maybe He has forgotten us, Davie,' the man
pitifully moaned, for even his strong courage had
broken down in face of this calamity.</p>

<p>'No, no,' soothed the boy. '"Yea, though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil; for Thou art with me:" is it not
so?'</p>

<p>There was something so calm, so trustful in
the child's faith in God's mercy, that the poor
stricken men listened as he tried to cheer them
with thoughts of that Power who is mighty to
save.</p>

<p>The weary hours dragged their slow length
along, and, though help came not yet, his perfect
trust in God never wavered. Some of the men
gave themselves up to despair, and lay down where
they had sat cowering, prepared to die. The
lamps went out by degrees as the oil was expended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
adding to the horror of the situation by leaving
them in utter darkness. And yet, though death
appeared so near, it had no terrors for little Davie,
for God was nearer still.</p>

<p>'Shall I sing to you, Master Morgan?' the boy
asked, as he laid his weary head down upon his
friend's broad shoulder.</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, my lad,' was the sole reply the poor
man could make.</p>

<p>Then through the awful silence and darkness
of this fearful grave rang the sweet, clear tones of
the child's voice, singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
'Rock of Ages, cleft for me,<br />
Let me hide myself in Thee.'<br />
</div></div>

<p>'Hark!' he cried, suddenly pausing in the
hymn; 'they are striving to clear the working&mdash;I
hear the sound of their picks! We are saved!
we are saved!' he joyously shouted.</p>

<p>With the sense of hearing preternaturally
sharpened, these poor men, who had given themselves
up for lost, also listened; those who had
lain down to die rising up and listening with
every nerve acutely strained to catch the faintest
sound. Yes, they could hear their deliverers
bravely working to set them free.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Then arose as with one voice their glad song of
deliverance,&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
'Thou canst save, and Thou alone!'<br />
</div></div>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Tenderly they bore him home to his mother,
that brave, noble child, whose simple trust had
sustained their failing hearts in that hour of trial
and suffering.</p>

<p>But reaction had set in, and he was weak and
fainting when they laid him in her arms, yet he
feebly murmured, striving for her sake to appear
still strong,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, mother darling, I am so glad to be at
home again! I thought I should never more see
you, nor my Evening Primrose. But, mother, why
is it still so dark?'</p>

<p>She glanced in terror at his soft blue eyes,
which to her looked as clear as ever. But why
was it that, though the morning light was streaming
in through the open window, to him it still
was dark?</p>

<p>She breathed not one word of her fear to him,
though the icy dread chilled her to the heart, but,
laying him gently down in his own cosy bed,
Soothed him with loving caresses, bidding him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>'Try to sleep, and forget it all!'</p>

<p>Then, when sleep came to the over-wrought
brain, she left him in the care of a kindly neighbour,
and went tremblingly forth to seek her
child's trusty old friend.</p>

<p>She found Mat Morgan seated in his arm-chair
(for, like the rest of the miners who had been
in this imminent peril, he had escaped unhurt),
recounting to a group of neighbours the wonderful
faith of little Davie, whose trust in God
never failed, even when the shadows of the
dark angel's wings had hovered so closely over
them.</p>

<p>'Oh, Master Morgan!' the poor mother cried,
as with clasped hands and quivering lips she overheard
him thus dilating on her boy's noble fortitude
and humble Christian faith; 'my darling
Davie! he will never, never look on us again this
side the grave. He'&mdash;</p>

<p>'He be no dead, ma'am!' exclaimed the old man,
starting from his chair, while sympathizing friends
gathered round her with words of tender pity.</p>

<p>'No, no, not dead, thank God!' she sobbed;
'but blind, I fear. Oh, my little boy, my Davie!'</p>

<p>'Maybe not,' he replied, endeavouring to comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
her. 'I'll jest go wi' ye. I've known sich things
afore, when men have been shut up in the dark
some hours,&mdash;and <i>we</i> were nigh upon three days in
the pit, mind ye&mdash;the shock of seein' the daylight
kind o' dazes the sight for a while. So ye must
not greet, but hope and trust in our heavenly
Father, as your little lad ever does, I'm thinkin'!
Come along.'</p>

<p>How eagerly did she hasten home, all anxiety
to prove if the old miner's opinion was right, and
'hoping against hope' that the child's sight had
become cleared while he slept, and that when he
awoke he would look upon her with unclouded
eyes. Her heart beat so violently she could
scarcely speak, as, standing by his bedside, she saw
his blue eyes were unclosed and apparently gazing
upon her where she stood with Mat Morgan by
her side.</p>

<p>'Davie,' she whispered softly, bending over him
and kissing the parted lips, 'here is Master
Morgan come to see you.'</p>

<p>'Where is he?' the boy joyfully cried. 'He
is not hurt, then? Oh, I am so glad! But, mother
dear, I cannot see him, nor you; there seems
like a shadow over my eyes. Oh, mother,' he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
piteously moaned, as the sad truth appeared to
strike him, 'tell me, I am not blind, am I?'</p>

<p>Then, as she could not for very anguish reply
to his eager question, his noble courage gave way,
and, throwing himself upon his pillow, he uttered a
piercing cry of untold despair.</p>

<p>The poor mother knelt beside him with arms
closely folding him to her heart, unable to soothe,
save with loving caresses, her child's unutterable
anguish.</p>

<p>'Nay, Davie, my man,' cried the old miner,
wiping his eyes with the back of his rough hand,
'ye did no greet when death a'most stared us
in the face; why do ye sorrow now, my brave
lad?'</p>

<p>'Oh, but then I should have been with God!
Now'&mdash;and his sobs redoubled&mdash;'I shall never see
mother's dear face again, nor yours, Master Morgan;
and for me my Evening Primrose will never open
its buds again. And oh, if I am blind, I can
never more be mother's little bread-winner.'</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The parable is told!</p>

<p>Little Davie eventually recovered his sight,
thanks to the generous kindness of the manager,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
who spared no means to procure the best surgical aid
for the poor little lad; and in the years that quickly
followed, he became the stay and comfort of his
widowed mother, retaining ever his filial affection
for her, and cherishing fond recollections of those
early days when his only treasures were her love
and his Evening Primrose.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE LITTLE SEED&mdash;KINDNESS.</h3>


<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_dropw.png" width="143" height="190" alt="'W" style="margin-top: -1em;" /></span><span class="upper">hy,</span> what have you got in your beak?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
asked a dingy London Sparrow of
another, just as dingy as himself.</p>

<p>'Well, I hardly know,' replied his friend,
laying down the article in question, and
surveying it critically with his head on one side;
'but it seems to me as though it is a seed&mdash;of
some sort!'</p>

<p>'So it is,' assented the other, as he hopped
nearer and attentively examined the treasure-trove.
'Yes,'&mdash;as if the idea had suddenly suggested
itself,&mdash;'yes, it <i>is</i> a seed. Where did you find it?'</p>

<p>'I did not steal it,' exclaimed the owner of the
property, who evidently resented a something in
his companion's manner of questioning; 'I honestly
picked it up in a garden, where it was lying on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the <i>top</i> of the earth, not <i>in</i> it,' he added, with
emphasis. 'I expect the wind blew it there, for
the gales have been very high these last few days.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' replied the questioner with alacrity;
perhaps he feared he had wounded his friend's
feelings, and dreaded lest there might ensue a
squabble, for sparrows, it must be confessed, are
easily affronted over trifles, though, as a rule, they
are good-tempered little fellows enough, putting up
with scanty fare and homely lodgings very contentedly
and cheerfully. 'I wonder what kind
of seed it is, do you know?' he still further
questioned, being of an inquisitive turn of mind.</p>

<p>'No, I do not,' replied the finder.</p>

<p>'Ah,' he said, with a sigh that ruffled all his
feathers, 'if we did but live in the beautiful
green hedgerows, instead of dwelling among town
chimneys, we should soon know what it was; our
country cousins would be able to tell us in a
moment if it was good to eat or not. By the bye,
shall you eat it?' he pursued, eyeing his friend in
the same keen way as he eyed occasional crumbs
of bread, his sharp little eye glancing quick and
bright whilst waiting for the reply.</p>

<p>'No,' answered the other; 'I shall give it away.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>'Give it away!' he repeated, in utter astonishment
at the idea; 'who to?'</p>

<p>'Why, in my travels about this city, I have
noticed a small window up among the chimneys
in the East End of London&mdash;it's a mere garret, I
expect.'</p>

<p>'Well?' ejaculated the listener, somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>'I have also observed,' pursued his companion
deliberately, 'that on the ledge of this window
there are two or three flower-pots with some tiny
pieces of green trying to shoot out of the dry
mould.'</p>

<p>'What have those flower-pots and the dry
mould to do with this seed?' was the question he
sharply put.</p>

<p>'I think,' continued the other Sparrow, not
heeding the interruption, 'this must be a flower-seed,
since I found it in a garden well known to
me for its loveliness,&mdash;for, as a rule, I go about
with my eyes open,' he added. 'Now at this attic
window of which I spoke,' he went on saying, 'I
have seen a poor pale-faced girl for ever bending
over needlework, although sometimes, but very
rarely, I have observed her carefully watering and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
tending those flower-pots with their feeble attempts
at greenery.'</p>

<p>'Have you nearly finished your touching description?'
asked the friend, with a sneer.</p>

<p>'Now,' went on the Sparrow, as though he had
not heard this remark, 'the soil does not look very
inviting, yet I have been thinking that, as there
has been rain during the night, the mould may be
a little softened perhaps; so if I alight on the
window-sill, and drop this seed into one of those
pots, a pretty flower <i>might</i> come up in time, and
then how glad the poor girl would be!&mdash;why, it
would actually give her happiness.'</p>

<p>And the reflection merely of this hoped-for
pleasure so brightened up the little bird that he
looked positively lovely! Not even a bird of
paradise could have appeared more glorious, dingy
brown though our tiny hero's plumage was; but
good deeds and kind words always bring a brightness
with them.</p>

<p>'Oh, that is what you intend doing!' remarked
the other, who had been pruning his flecked
feathers whilst listening to this delightful plan;&mdash;perhaps
he might have imagined the treasure
would come to him, since his friend was not going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to keep it himself. 'You are very generous,' he
added, with a slight touch of sarcasm.</p>

<p>But the kind little Sparrow did not mind; his
heart was too full of noble intentions to notice
trivial things. He merely said,&mdash;</p>

<p>'So now I'm off! Good-bye for the present. I
shall be back in time for roost.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you are going, are you?' was the comment,
as his friend picked up the seed again in
his beak and flew away.</p>

<p>But, as he darted off, a sunbeam peeped round
a corner just to see what the dear little fellow
looked like, and this very sunbeam threw such a
halo around him, you would have thought his
feathers had been burnished gold. Then his voice,
too, sounded so cheerily, as, with a merry 'Twit-twit-twee,'
he disappeared from view, intent on his
errand of kindness.</p>

<p>'I'm sure I should not have troubled myself
to carry that burden so far, but should have eaten
it for my dinner,' muttered the one sitting on
the water-spout. 'Dear me, what's that?' as he
caught sight of a shadow round an angle of the
roof. 'Oh, gracious!' and he gave such a jump in
his terror, as he recognised Pussie taking a walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
on the tiles, looking out for her dinner, no
doubt.</p>

<p>You may be quite sure Mr. Sparrow did not
wait until Pussie came up to him, but flew away
to a safe distance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other bird was speeding on his
errand of kindness. He did not feel the weight
of his burden, but went bravely on, only occasionally
resting on a water-spout or a parapet, just for
a second or two, but never losing sight of his
precious seed; though sometimes he was sadly
annoyed by other Sparrows coming up, and, with
great fuss and chatter, inquiring as to what he
was so carefully carrying. But he was very
cautious, and always kept an eye upon his treasure
(answering their questions curtly), for London
Sparrows have the character of being not <i>too</i>
honest, with what truth it cannot be said; let us
hope the charge is unfounded. Still our hero
thought it advisable to be watchful; therefore,
after satisfying all curiosity on the subject, as
much at least as he deemed needful, he flew off
again on his mission&mdash;without telling them the
ultimate destination of his seed, fearing, perhaps,
they might be unable to resist the temptation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
picking it out of the mould into which he intended
to drop it.</p>

<p>By and by he left the more respectable part of
the city, and winged his way as near as he could
remember towards the attic window, where he
had so often seen the poor work-girl busy at her
weary task. But a heavy cloud of smoke darkened
the air, and a perfect forest of masts bewildered
him, for he had come to that part of London
where the ships are to be seen&mdash;thousands of
vessels from all countries of the world. Still,
though he was puzzled for a while, yet he felt sure
the house was near this place, as he recollected
having seen these docks before. What should he
do? He paused for a bit upon a slanting roof just
to look around. Oh, the smuts, how they settled
upon his feathers! he was obliged to preen himself,
he felt so dirty; if his coat was a dingy brown,
there was no occasion for its being dirty also!
All at once, as he paused during the process of
preening, he saw the very window right in front of
him,&mdash;he recognised it by its cleanliness, such a
contrast to the squalor around. Yes, there it was,
the polished panes of glass glinting in the gleams
of light that came now and then through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
murky atmosphere; and there were the three flower-pots.
Why, actually they had been washed, they
looked so freshly red!&mdash;or perhaps painted.</p>

<p>Away he joyfully flew, his task was nearly done;
but alas for hopes of birds or people! Just as
he was about to alight upon the window-sill, a
tiresome bird&mdash;a Sparrow&mdash;came flying towards
him, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hallo! who are you, I should like to know?'
and so startled was he when accosted thus abruptly,
that in his fright he dropped his dear and precious
treasure.</p>

<p>Down, down it fell upon a deal case a man was
wheeling on a truck. The man did not notice the
tiny grain that fell; perhaps, had he done so, would
merely have thought it was a particle of dust;
but the poor bird's heart was sorely grieved as he
saw it disappear, after all the trouble he had
taken to bring it thus far, and he sat upon the
window-ledge of the girl's room with ruffled plumage
and dim eyes, utterly crushed by this untoward
loss. It was too bad!</p>

<p>But after a while he took heart, and looked the
disappointment boldly in the face, which is always
the better plan than brooding over it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>'It can't be helped,' he said wisely, rousing
from his sorrowful reflections, and giving his
feathers a shake together. 'I did my best, and
could do no more. It is a loss certainly, but no
doubt there are other flower-seeds to be found, so
I'll go to-morrow morning to that same garden,
and see if there are any more to be had. Dear
me!' he continued, glancing up with his now
bright eyes at the sky; 'why, it is getting late.
I must make haste home, or else my friends
will be anxious, and fear that I have come to
grief.'</p>

<p>So saying, he flew away, not without a note of
farewell to the girl, who had been looking at him
all the time he sat there so disconsolately, wondering
in her own mind why he was perched there so
ruffled and sad, little dreaming of his kindly
intentions towards her&mdash;how should she?&mdash;so
away he went, and reached his place of abode
just as his brothers and friends were going to
roost.</p>

<p>You may be quite sure he was received with a
perfect volley of questions.</p>

<p>'Where have you been?' asked some who were
ignorant of his scheme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>'How did you manage?' questioned others who
knew.</p>

<p>'What sort of a place is it?' inquired several.</p>

<p>Poor little bird! he was obliged to confess his
failure, which he did with reluctance; yet still he
bore his disappointment so cheerfully and bravely,
they could not help sympathizing with him,
promising to help in the good work next time.
Even the Sparrow who had jeered somewhat at
him was really sorry, and consoled him so kindly,
that he went to sleep with his head tucked under
his wing, in a far happier frame of mind than he
could have supposed possible, after such a grievous
sorrow.</p>

<p>And the seed?</p>

<p>As it was being jostled on the top of the
packing-case, it thought to itself:</p>

<p>'There's an end to me, I suppose. I shall be
shrivelled up to nothing for want of nourishing
earth, and shall do good to no one. What a pity
that dear little Sparrow's kind intention was frustrated
by that meddlesome and inquisitive bird!
I am sure I would have done my duty to the
utmost, and realized his wish by growing as fast
as possible, and looking cheerful and gay when in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
flower. Well, well, it is no use being unhappy; I
must only wait patiently, hoping that a chance
of doing good may occur. Who knows what may
happen?'</p>

<p>And at that very moment, the truck the man was
wheeling gave a lurch, and in consequence the
tiny seed rolled along until it slipped down a
crevice in the lid, and found a comfortable resting-place
inside amongst some soft hay with which
the case was packed.</p>

<p>'This is cosy,' it remarked, nestling in the
warmth; 'perhaps after all I am reserved for some
good purpose. I had become desponding, but
there is always a brightness behind the darkest
cloud.'</p>

<p>So it cuddled down contentedly, not knowing
or heeding whither it was taken, only resting
satisfied with the reflection that whatever happened
was for the best. And so the packing-case
was put on board one of the great ships
in the docks, and in a few days away sailed the
ship, packing-case, and little seed, far over the
ocean, leaving England many thousand miles
behind.</p>

<p>Not having been to Australia, we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
describe what the little seed next beheld. But
when the sun once again shone upon it, it was
in a very different country to this dear land of
ours.</p>

<p>The case had been emptied of its contents, and
the hay and straw with which it had been packed
was thrown aside upon the ground, and there lay
the seed, so tiny that it was quite unheeded, indeed
it is to be doubted whether it was even seen; but
the loving God, who has created nothing in vain,
had still a use for the small grain. A soft wind
came and carried it to some moist earth, into which
it sank, thankful for the rest and quiet after the
past turmoil.</p>

<p>But its work was not finished.</p>

<p>By and by came up a little slender green shoot,
then a leaf or two, and after a while, in due
season, some pretty bell-shaped flowers, almost
white, with just a tinge of delicate purple, made
their appearance, and there they swayed in the
breeze&mdash;English Wood Anemones in a distant
land.</p>

<p>And in this distant land a young English girl
had her home; and bright and beautiful it was,
with huge trees and gorgeous flowers, unheard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and unseen in the country village from which she
had come. But, bright and beautiful as her new
home was, she often sighed for the green hedgerows
and sweet wayside flowers of dear old
England; not that she murmured because God
had sent her thither, only the love of her old
home and old home memories yet lingered in her
heart.</p>

<p>Think, then, what her joy was, when, one day as
she wandered alone, gazing on gorgeous blossoms
rich in brilliant colours, down at her feet she spied,
waving its delicate-tinted elf-bells in the warm,
soft breeze, the Wood Anemone.</p>

<p>Could it be possible? That well-known English
flower blooming there! How could it have come
across the ocean?</p>

<p>Ah, how often had she seen it at home&mdash;for
England is ever home to those who are far away&mdash;seen
it in the early spring days clustering thickly
in the woods and copse, heralding the cuckoo,
and bringing with it a promise of summer days to
come.</p>

<p>'Dear, dear little flower!' she cried, kneeling
down and kissing, in excess of joy, its delicate
petals. 'Welcome a thousand times, for you bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
with you memories from the old land. I will not
gather your pretty flowers, nor take them away to
myself, but will leave you here, so that others,
perhaps more home-sick than I, will take heart,
and be cheered by your soothing though silent
message.'</p>

<p>And the young girl was right.</p>

<p>Others passing by&mdash;some poor wanderers, footsore
and weary&mdash;were cheered by the bonnie wild-flower,
which, happy in giving happiness to others,
swayed its tiny bells as it danced in utter gladness,
whispering to the wild bees who also came to
visit it,&mdash;</p>

<p>'I thought at one time, when the Sparrow let
me fall, that there was no more use for me in the
world, that my work was finished; but God had
still a mission for me, and I have done what
others equally small can do&mdash;given happiness, and
cheered those who came across my path. It is
not much to do,' it continued meekly, 'not great
and glorious deeds at which the world stands
amazed; but it was all I could do, and was the
work He meant for me&mdash;we must not despise
the day of small things. The acorn is very
small, yet look at the oak. A gentle word, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
bright smile, is not hard to bestow, but oh, the
blessing they can be to hearts pining perhaps for
kindness!'</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>So the Sparrow's good intention was carried out
after all.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE CROWN IMPERIAL&mdash;HOPE.</h3>


<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_droph.png" width="133" height="189" alt="H" style="margin-top: -1em;" /></span><span class="upper">ave</span> you ever seen a Crown Imperial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that lovely flower which comes in
the early spring-time, just after the
Snowdrops have gone? You will not find
it in <i>new</i> gardens, I fear; but in those delightful
shady nooks and corners where the old-fashioned
flowers seem to come and go just as
they please, there it is to be found, coming up
year after year in all its beauty, and yet, though
so lovely, meekly drooping its velvet petals, upon
which tear-drops are ever resting.</p>

<p>It has been said that it droops thus in humiliation,
because its pride was once rebuked; but
I do not think that aught so lovely could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
unduly proud! Even the acknowledged queen
of the garden, the stately Rose, is gentle in
her beauty; and 'Consider the lilies,' though
'Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed' like
them, yet how meekly they bloom beneath our
feet!</p>

<p>Then shall the Crown Imperial tell its tale to
you, and see what lesson we can learn from it?
No, an old yew tree shall relate the story. Listen
to what it says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Many, many years have I stood on this spot,
from the time that I was a tiny sapling until now,
when my branches spread far and wide, covering
the earth beneath with shadow. Summer sunshine
has touched with its fiercely scorching breath,
and winter snows have shrouded me in fleecy
garments, but the old yew tree has weathered
so far the storms of life, growing year by year
more twisted and gnarled as time passed on.
I have seen the song-birds come and depart;
some have even built their nests within my
leafy branches. I have watched sweet flowers
blossom, then fade, but among the many lovely
flowerets I have loved&mdash;for the old dry tree
has a tender heart, my children&mdash;there was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
whose very gentleness made me love it even
yet more dearly. It was a Crown Imperial.</p>

<p>'The spring was commencing to gladden the
earth when first I perceived it, forcing its way
timidly through the soft grassy lawn of an old, old
garden. Who had placed the parent bulb beneath
that turf was never known, for the owners of the
estate had passed with their generation from the
land, and strangers had come to reside in the
ancient homestead, but there was this fragile plant,
outliving, as it were, those who had planted it,
and coming up, year after year, to gladden other
eyes than those which had first beheld its beauty&mdash;like
good actions and gentle words&mdash;imperishable!</p>

<p>'So day by day I watched it grow, stronger and
stronger, higher and higher, and, as it grew, spreading
gradually its beautiful, shining leaves; but
when it had reached its full height, behold, it was
crowned with a diadem of the softest green&mdash;an
emerald crown worthy the brow of a queen!</p>

<p>'Then by degrees I saw its blossoms begin to
unfold, the velvet petals richer far than the feeble
looms of man can weave; but, as they unclosed, to
my intense surprise, they were not uplifted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
sunshine and blue sky, but meekly bowed&mdash;drooping
earthward.</p>

<p>'"They will gaze upward by and by," I said to
myself, "and, when they know and feel the power
of their beauty, will court the admiration they are
sure to win."</p>

<p>'But I was wrong.</p>

<p>'Pride had no place within their lowly hearts&mdash;never
were their flowers lifted up&mdash;their glances
were ever bent in sweet humility towards the green
sod from which they had sprung, and, as I gazed
upon them, I saw that on each lovely petal there
ever rested a tear.</p>

<p>'"Why this sadness?" I mused. "Surely so
lovely and guileless a flower can know no sorrow,
since sorrow often goes hand in hand with sin;
this Crown Imperial must surely be as faultless as
it is beautiful!"</p>

<p>'Yet I hesitated to ask the reason; there was
a gentle and reserved timidity about it, that
checked all questionings. The cause of this unspoken
grief would be revealed to me sooner or
later, I felt convinced.</p>

<p>'The days passed on with sunshine and shadows,
and, as the hours fled, I saw with regret that stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Time had relentlessly breathed with his withering
breath upon my much-loved flower! Gradually
and slowly its blossoms pined, the lovely colours
faded,&mdash;almost imperceptibly, 'tis true, still they
faded,&mdash;its fresh green crown became less purely
bright, and I knew with anguish my sweet one
was dying.</p>

<p>'Then, and not till then, did it raise its faint
eyes heavenward&mdash;they were tearless now. I
could restrain my wonder no more.</p>

<p>'"Why, oh, why wert thou weeping and gazing
ever earthward when in thy peerless beauty, sad
and disconsolate&mdash;and now that thou art fading
from us thou art happy?" I asked in my sorrowful
regret; perhaps reproach was mingled with my
complaint.</p>

<p>'"Is it not ever so?" the gentle flower replied.
"Whilst burdened with Life's sorrows, our eyes are
tear-dimmed. The cares of this world press
heavily upon our hearts, so that we scarce can lift
our thoughts from this earth&mdash;cold and weary
though it is&mdash;to gaze upward. It is only when
we are passing from all shadows into the Divine
Light that we can look heavenward, yet even then
the tear-drops linger. But when earthly sojourners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
have passed through the dark valley into the
Eternal Brightness, then, and only then, will they
be freed from anguish; then, and only then,
will eyes be no longer dimmed by sorrow&mdash;for
God Himself shall wipe away all tears!"'</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE TWO LEAVES&mdash;DISCONTENT.</h3>


<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_dropo.png" width="129" height="190" alt="O" style="margin-top: -.5em;" /></span><span class="upper">nce</span> upon a time, as the good old fairy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
tales always begin, there grew by the
side of a little brook a large Oak tree.</p>

<p>The brook was a bright, sunlit stream,
gliding along so cheerfully to join the river,
between grassy banks, kissing the willows which
bent down towards it, or whispering softly to the
blue Forget-me-nots; and so clear was it, you
could see the smooth pebbles lying at the bottom,
and the fish skimming along gaily, as if there
were no such things in the whole world as fishing-rods.</p>

<p>All through the day it rippled merrily, catching
every ray of sunlight that flickered through the
trees or the blue sky above; but if an angry black
cloud ever chanced to see itself reflected in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
clear mirror, it scudded away as if ashamed of
looking so dark.</p>

<p>But at night, when the holy stars were shining,
ah, how softly the little brook murmured to them!
you could almost fancy it did not babble so loudly
as in the day-time, for fear lest it should wake the
sleeping flowers on its mossy banks.</p>

<p>It was a happy little stream, so calm, so placid,
no angry ripples ever disturbed its pure surface,
over which the Swallows lightly skimmed. And
it meandered along for many miles; sometimes you
would lose sight of it altogether, then out it would
come from some quiet, grassy nook, gaily sparkling,
and glide with a merry sound, as if laughing,
towards the steady rushes, and they would sway
to and fro at its approach, dancing to its rippling
music.</p>

<p>But, as I was saying, a sturdy Oak grew by the
side of the brook; it had sprung from an acorn
many hundred years ago, now it was very old.
Wintry storms had vainly tried to subdue it;
many a time they had bent its branches, plucked
at its roots, but fruitless was their fury, for the
noble tree firmly held its place, rearing its proud
head more loftily than ever; and so the storms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
finding their power availed them nought, passed
away over the land, howling with rage at their
failure.</p>

<p>Then, oh, how the birds loved the clear old tree!
Summer after summer did they return to build
nests among its moss-grown branches; and the
branches, glad that the songsters had come back
again, would put forth green leaves to hide them
from prying eyes, so that they could rest there
securely. Can you wonder, then, that they sang
sweet songs of gratitude to it, and that the little
brook should murmur her sweet melody as she
glided along at its feet?</p>

<p>On the opposite bank grew an Aspen.</p>

<p>It was not so old as the Oak, who had seen it
grow up from a mere sapling; still they had been
neighbours for many years, and the graceful Aspen
looked with love and reverence upon her aged
friend's sturdy face and form. Often, in the calm
summer nights, the Oak would talk to her of the
days of the long-ago; you would have thought it
was merely the breeze sighing amidst the branches,
but it was the voice of the Oak telling of the
past.</p>

<p>Many of the birds imagined the Aspen to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
weak, trembling tree, quivering always with fear
at the slightest wind that ruffled its branches.</p>

<p>'Scarcely safe to build a nest in!' so said an
old motherly Rook, who had reared many a brood.</p>

<p>But the fairies who danced beneath its shade
on bright moonlight nights knew better; they
knew that the fragile-<i>looking</i> tree never trembled
with fear; they had often seen it meekly bend
beneath the sway of the fierce wintry blasts,
knowing full well whose hand guided the storm;
and when the summer came they knew that then
it quivered with happiness at being created on so
fair an earth, and that its leaves only shook with
quiet laughter as it listened to the merry chatter
of the brook.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;winter had passed with his frosts and
snows, and spring was scattering her flowers everywhere.
The Cuckoo was calling aloud, 'Cuckoo,
cuckoo,' all day long, never heeding the young
folks who mocked his song; even the Swallows
had returned from the warm, sunny South, and
were for ever skimming over the brook, just
dipping their wings into its limpid waves, then off
again with the joyous 'Twit, twit, twit.' The
meadows, too, were yellow with buttercups, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
which the cows waded knee-deep. Talk of the
Field of the Cloth of Gold! Francis the First
would have been a clever man could he have
made such an one!&mdash;no earthly king could create
golden fields like these.</p>

<p>All nature was rejoicing in earth's brightness,
and our old friends the Oak and the Aspen as
much as any. They had put forth their fresh
green leaves, and beneath their shade many a tired
traveller rested from the noonday sun, thanking
them both in his heart for the welcome shelter.</p>

<p>During the winter the Oak had not been idle,
for it had extended its branches far and wide;
one, indeed, stretched right across the brook, in
fact, almost touched its opposite neighbour, and
the Aspen welcomed it gladly. You would have
thought it great happiness to live in such a lovely
spot, I know, but there is never perfect bliss, and
if little folks <i>will</i> be discontented, they make the
prettiest place appear wretched and miserable.</p>

<p>Now, among the leaves of the Oak there was
one that was always restless and fidgety. In vain
the sweet birds perched near and sang to him,
and the gentle brook murmured tales of other
scenes&mdash;he never seemed happy. The fairies, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
as I before said, danced by moonlight at the very
foot of the parent tree, yet even that brave sight
gave him no pleasure, though his brother and
sister leaves would clap their tiny hands in
ecstasy.</p>

<p>'It disturbed his sleep,' he said. 'Why could
they not dance in the day-time?&mdash;not when all
respectable leaves and flowers were sleeping!
making such a noise, especially that mischievous
Puck!'</p>

<p>And, unfortunately, he grew on the branch
nearest to the Aspen, and his constant grumbles
made them quiver with sorrow and pain at such
incessant complainings. As to his own relatives,
they would not listen, but frisked about merrily
enough when the zephyrs came and played with
them.</p>

<p>'Alas!' said he one day to a little Aspen leaf
that grew on a branch close by, and who had
patiently borne with his ungrateful complaints;
'how sad is our lot! Here we are always attached
to the same place, in a state of cruel bondage;
everything around us moves: the birds, happy in
their liberty, fly here and there, singing ever their
songs of joy; even the beasts of the forests are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
free&mdash;whilst we&mdash;ah me!&mdash;we never lose our
galling chains but in dying!'</p>

<p>'Why do you murmur thus?' asked the Aspen
leaf in a sweet, tremulous voice; 'why are you
not contented?'</p>

<p>'Oh, it is all very well for you to preach contentment,'
it pertly replied, turning up its point
with contempt. 'I am a leaf of intellect. I hate
this aimless, monotonous life; it does very well
for such silly, trembling things as you and yours,&mdash;not
for me!'</p>

<p>For a moment the little Aspen leaf felt its pride
wounded by the contemptuous speech of its
neighbour, and was strongly disposed to answer
in the same strain; but fortunately, a fairy who
chanced to be passing at the time laid her silver
wand lightly on its lips, so with a smile she merely
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, I know I am timid, and cling to my
parent tree for security and protection. What
would you do if you were free? We are so happy
here, I would not leave my home; the soft breezes
are ever among us with cheerful stories of the
countries they have visited to amuse us; and as to
the birds, why, all the day long they are singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
their sweetest melodies to gladden our hearts and
cheer us.'</p>

<p>'I have heard their songs until I am quite tired
of their sameness,' was the ungrateful response;
'besides, in a few months the cold winds will be
here, and then we shall fall to the ground and be
trodden under foot&mdash;that will be the end of us.
So I am determined to see something of the world
before that time comes. I shall go off with the
first north wind that visits us&mdash;so I tell you.
You will not reason me out of my plan.'</p>

<p>'Oh, stay, stay with us!' cried the trembling
listener; 'you cannot surely know the sorrow you
would cause, nor the troubles you would have to
endure. It is true we leave our kind branches
but to die, but we are not carelessly trodden on;
the rustling of we poor faded leaves beneath man's
feet recall to his mind pure and holy thoughts of
the unknown future, filling his heart with unuttered
prayers to the Great Power who changeth not.
Then, if we poor leaves can teach a lesson, we have
not lived in vain. Do not murmur at your humble
fate, dear friend, but stay with us, contented with
your simple destiny and the goodness of God.'</p>

<p>The Aspen leaf ceased speaking, overcome by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
its emotion, whilst the little grumbler, silenced, but
not convinced, turned sulkily away. It did not
relish the kind advice of its true friend, nor did
it at all intend to follow it, but still it settled
down on its tiny twig so very quietly, that all its
relatives firmly believed it had given up its foolish
scheme of imaginary happy freedom; but they
were mistaken, for a few days after a north wind
came quite unexpectedly upon them. It bent
the Aspen tree almost to breaking, still the loving
little leaves clung trembling to their parent,
feeling that their very safety rested on their
keeping close to it. Then, finding its strength
was in vain, away the north wind rushed to the
sturdy old Oak, swaying its branches wildly
about, and even making them crack in its fierce
rage.</p>

<p>But the Oak reared its proud head defiantly,
and its leaves hung tightly on&mdash;all save one.
Alas! with a mocking laugh at his friends' and
his brothers' fears, he threw himself into the arms
of the cruel north wind, who bore him swiftly
away, and ere the night came the foolish leaf lay
faded and dead.</p>

<p>As he was whirled away, a sad, sad moan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
sighed through the branches of the old Oak.
'Twas a cry of anguish for its wilful child.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The bright summer was gone.</p>

<p>One by one the leaves were falling. With a
gentle rustle they fell from their parent trees, and
lay in their faded beauty upon the earth.</p>

<p>The little Aspen leaf lingered, but one day a
soft, sweet zephyr came and gently released her,
and she fluttered slowly down to the calm bosom
of the little brook, who had, alas! seen many
flowers bloom and die.</p>

<p>Tenderly the stream bore it away to a grassy
nook on its banks, and there it placed the tiny
leaf, alone in its quiet rest.</p>

'Who'll buy my roses? they're lovely and fair,<br />
They're Nature's own bloom, and are fed on fresh air.'<br />

<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_drops.png" width="125" height="190" alt="S" style="margin-top: -1em;" /></span><span class="upper">o</span> sang a little girl, as she walked along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a shady lane, carrying a basket of
those glorious flowers which she was
taking to a friend as a birthday gift; and
so on she went, singing her song of Roses,
sweet Roses, little thinking that others were
listening to her melody (besides the birds), or
that her simple words would raise angry feelings
in the very flowers themselves.</p>

<p>'Oh yes!' exclaimed a small Wild-flower&mdash;its
name I will not tell; 'oh yes!' she repeated, waiting
until the singer was out of hearing; 'always
Roses, or Violets, or Lilies&mdash;no one ever composes
songs about&mdash;<i>us</i>&mdash;we are only common flowers.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>'Don't say so,' interposed Pimpernel, 'because
that is not true. There is a poem on a Daisy that
will ever be remembered, and I have heard some
children sing a pretty one about Buttercups and
Daisies, besides.'</p>

<p>'Oh, of course you uphold these song-makers,
because your name has appeared in print,' she
interrupted, with a toss of her bonnie petals; 'but
no one has ever noticed me.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense!' said Ragged Robin, who, having
been of a wandering disposition, had seen and
heard a great deal in his time; 'why, there is one
poet who says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />
And waste its fragrance on the desert air."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Therefore, if you are not mentioned by name, you
certainly must be included among these unknowns
who are born to blush unseen.'</p>

<p>'I don't want to be included among these
"unknowns" then,' exclaimed the Flower angrily.
'I am sure I am'&mdash;she hesitated a moment&mdash;'quite
as lovely as a Rose, or any other garden
beauty;' but she could not help hanging her head
for very shame whilst uttering this piece of
self-conceit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! oh! oh!' were the exclamations to be
heard on all sides.</p>

<p>'So I am,' she persisted, going on now in sheer
desperation, having proceeded too far to retract.
'My petals are delicately fair, with just a faint
rosy blush, my pistils and stamens of a tender
yellow, and my form, if fragile, is very graceful&mdash;so
there!'</p>

<p>You may imagine the laughter that ensued as
she ended with that emphatic 'so there!' laughter
which could not be suppressed, although she plainly
showed her anger at their behaviour; they could
not help it, so flower-bells shook and leaves fluttered
with mirth, even Quaker grass quivered
with merriment.</p>

<p>'I would advise you to be more contented,' said
a Honeysuckle, as she looked down upon the
ambitious little Flower from her own elevated
position; 'let me tell you it is not always those
who are highest up in the world are the happiest;
they feel the cold winds quite as keenly, perhaps
more so.'</p>

<p>'Ah, but I want to live in a conservatory or
a greenhouse. I feel I am fitted for that
position,' grumbled the other; 'in such a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
I should be more seen, and consequently more
admired and appreciated.'</p>

<p>'What vanity!' sneered wild Vetch, who was
somewhat ambitious also, seeing he tried to climb
up as high as he could.</p>

<p>An angry retort was on the lips of the one
addressed, but Honeysuckle interposed, by saying
kindly,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, well, we shall see,&mdash;perhaps your position
may be altered one day, and then you will be
able to show us how you bear prosperity. Many
flowers I have known transplanted to conservatories,
thinking they would prove to be exotics,
but I have heard that they generally withered
in the heated atmosphere to which they were
removed, and did not come to perfection when
taken from their native soil.'</p>

<p>'I am sure I should enjoy the change,' was the
answer vouchsafed to this friendly warning. 'I
know I am not in my proper sphere; such beauty
as mine was never surely intended by Nature for
a hedgerow.'</p>

<p>'We shall see!' cried several Blossoms, who
felt indignant at her contemptuous way of
speaking. 'Your parents were no doubt'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>'Exotics, I am convinced,' she said.</p>

<p>'Then how came you here among such humble
company?' asked merry Ragged Robin, who was
fond of teasing.</p>

<p>She deigned no reply, but looked him scornfully
up and down, to his intense amusement.</p>

<p>'Let her alone!' cried a sturdy Bramble; 'she
will buy her experience with sighs and tears, I
fear.'</p>

<p>So, acting upon Bramble's advice, they did leave
her alone to muse over her ambitious hopes and
desires, whilst they, contented and happy with their
lowly fate, opened their buds to the bright sunshine,
which beams alike upon the high or humble.</p>

<p>And very pretty looked that hedgerow on this
same morning. The flowers were so lovely and
fresh, for their gentle Mother Nature had washed
their bonnie faces fresh with dew, and so they
held their petals up to catch the sun's brightest
rays, which came in golden gleams through the
thickly-leaved hedges above them. What life
could possibly be happier? There were the birds
flying about, cheering them with merry twitterings,
as they sped from tree to tree, or perched
in the boughs overhead, warbling ever their songs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
gladness. Then the bees would come, and ask
them, in drowsy, murmuring voices, for just a sip
of nectar from their cups, a boon which was never
refused, and in return the busy little workers
would leave them some pollen to colour their
petals, and render them (if it were possible) more
lovely than before. The butterflies, too, would
alight on their leaves, and display their brilliant
hues for their admiration, or the gay dragon-flies
would fly about them in that wandering fashion
peculiar to those gorgeous insects, darting hither
and thither like flashes of rainbow light. At night
the moonlight would kiss their weary eyes to
sleep, whilst the soft night-breezes soothed them
to rest with murmuring lullabies.</p>

<p>It is true there were storms sometimes, and the
cold rain would fall upon them; but still they
were sheltered from all fierce tempests, and would
rise up refreshed after the dark clouds had passed
away, for they knew</p>

<p>and as to the summer showers, why, they tossed
their heads, and laughed merrily at them, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the light rain-drops from their petals in playful
fun.</p>

<p>But on this morning, when the tiny Wild-flower
was making her life miserable by useless
repinings at her humble lot, and sighing for&mdash;she
knew not what!&mdash;well, on this same morning
there was not a cloud to dim the sky, so brightly
blue was it, and the soft west wind crept among
the leaves and flowers, whispering to them the
glad tidings of 'Summer is come!'</p>

<p>I do not know how long it was after the little
girl had passed, that a gentleman came sauntering
slowly up the lane; and as he went, he would stop
every now and then to examine the hedgerow
flowers and shrubs. All at once he espied our
friend, almost hidden though she was by the
leaves and long grass around.</p>

<p>'What a lovely little flower!' he exclaimed, as
he stooped down to examine more closely his
newly-found treasure; 'how delicate in colour,
how sweet in perfume! Surely this was never
intended to remain hidden in a hedge?'</p>

<p>Oh, if you could but have seen how she tried
to raise her pretty head, which Nature had bowed
in simple loveliness, and endeavoured to look big,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
little thinking that her greatest charm lay in this
sweet simplicity.</p>

<p>'I must certainly transplant it to my greenhouse,'
he went on saying. 'With care and skill,
who knows into what it may not develop!&mdash;an
entirely new plant, I doubt not. I will at once
take it home.'</p>

<p>And away he went to procure the necessary
tools for removing her from her lowly home to
one more suited to her wishes.</p>

<p>'Did I not tell you so!' was her delighted
exclamation.</p>

<p>'Well, I never!' ejaculated Pimpernel, whose
pretty eyes were now opened wide in astonishment.</p>

<p>'Better to be born lucky than rich,' muttered
Ragged Robin.</p>

<p>'Shall I not be grand in a conservatory?' cried
the ambitious Flower.</p>

<p>'I would rather</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Adorn the rustic stibble-field,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Unseen, alane,"'</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>murmured meek Daisy.</p>

<p>'Ah, you have no ambition!' sneered the other;
'besides, "the rustic stibble-field" is your proper
sphere&mdash;it is not mine!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>'Pride, pride!' rebuked Honeysuckle, gazing
sorrowfully down upon the arrogant little speaker.
'Take care that you sigh not yet for your old
home and humble friends.'</p>

<p>'Indeed I shall not!' she retorted insolently.</p>

<p>'Wait, wait!' continued sturdy Bramble; ''tis
the time of flowers now&mdash;wait till the fruit-time
comes.'</p>

<p>'I do not know what you mean,' she retorted
angrily; 'nor do I'&mdash;</p>

<p>'That there is a time for all things,' explained
Shepherd's Clock, interrupting her.</p>

<p>'I trust your high hopes will be realized,' said
Speedwell kindly.</p>

<p>How much longer this wrangling would have
continued it is impossible to say, for at that
moment the gentleman returned with a trowel,
spade, and basket, and proceeded to remove her
from her native soil. In justice to her, it must
be confessed that, when the moment came to part
for ever from all her old friends, and the surroundings
to which, in spite of her incessant murmurs,
she felt attached, she clung desperately with
her slender, fibrous roots to the familiar spot
where from a seedling she had lived and grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>yes,
clung desperately! But with the utmost
care every tender fibre was released, and she was
placed in the basket and carried away. Was she
glad now? No, far from it&mdash;wishing again and
again that she had been left alone.</p>

<p>However, it was too late. She had always complained
of not being in her proper position, and
now the glorious change was come; she was being
taken to where her hopes had aspired,&mdash;a conservatory
or a greenhouse, it mattered not which.</p>

<p>After a while, with the usual indifference of
such natures, her regrets subsided, giving place to
thoughts respecting the place in which she was
destined to live.</p>

<p>'Of course I shall be welcomed by all the
nobler flowers with delight and astonishment,' she
mused; 'delight because of my agreeable manners,
and astonishment at my beauty! How I wish my
old hedgerow friends could but be present to
witness my reception!'</p>

<p>But this reception, upon which she built such
bright fancies, was delayed for some few days, for,
on arriving at her destination, she was carried into
a dingy shed, not into the splendid glass palace
her visions had conjured up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>'Is this the place to which I am destined?' she
muttered complainingly. 'Oh dear! no one will
see me here. I wish I had remained in the lane,
for there was a chance of my being admired by
some passer-by. What is the use of my ambitious
hopes, if this is to be the end of them?'</p>

<p>Fortunately there was no flower or even a
plant near to be wearied with her repinings, so on
she grumbled, until at last her misery reached its
climax, when she was taken and pressed tightly
into a horrible flower-pot, then carefully watered,
and afterwards put into a dark corner to take root.
Had she been capable of shedding tears, no water
would have been required, such as was given to
revive her; for the sorrow she felt was almost
too great to be borne. Here was a life to lead
after all her high aspirations, and her slender roots,
too, were so cramped and squeezed it was something
dreadful! Oh for the once despised hedgerow,
with the soft, cool earth, in which she could
stretch her delicate fibres!</p>

<p>But wait, impatient little flower! other days
are coming.</p>

<p>One morning&mdash;at least so it proved to be,
though at the time she did not know it, as in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
dark dwelling she saw neither sunrise nor sunset&mdash;well,
this morning of which we speak, to her
intense delight, the gentleman came and carried
her out into the open air, and surveyed her
critically.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she heard him say, and how her heart
bounded with pride, 'it is indeed a lovely flower,
and may well take its place among those in the
conservatory, for it is really exquisite.'</p>

<p>Here was a triumph! this was the hour to
which she had so long looked forward.</p>

<p>'At last, at last!' she murmured. 'Oh, if my
old acquaintances could but see me now, what
would they say? I wish some of them were here.'</p>

<p>Not satisfied even yet! You see there is
always an alloy in our greatest earthly pleasures
or triumphs&mdash;always a something wanting. Yet
so completely bewildered was she by this excess
of gratified pride, that she knew not whither she
was borne, until, when the delirium, for such it
was, had passed, she found herself in a place
which her wildest imaginings never could have
supposed possible&mdash;a wondrous glass palace, filled
with the most gorgeous flowers of all tints and
forms, some deliciously perfumed, making the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
fragrant; whilst in the centre of this palace a
fountain rose and fell with soothing murmurs,
scattering its silvery spray upon exquisite blossoms
that floated in the marble basin. It was almost
too lovely, and our little wayside friend sighed
with a sense of overpowering astonishment at the
wondrous beauties around, beauties that dazzled
her unaccustomed eyes. Her place, however, was
upon one of the lower shelves, and above her head
waved the feathery leaves of tropical plants, which
throve wonderfully well in the heated atmosphere
of this (to her) paradise.</p>

<p>Then she was left alone with her new associates&mdash;alone!
how much that word conveys!</p>

<p>After some time the other flowers became aware
of a stranger having come among them, and a
flutter (as much as such well-bred creatures deigned
to evince) stirred their leaves and petals.</p>

<p>'What is she like?' asked a Maidenhair Fern,
who from her position could get not even a glimpse
of the new arrival.</p>

<p>'Is she elegant and refined?' inquired a
Camellia languidly.</p>

<p>'Is she fair or dark?' questioned Tea-Rose, with
a faint breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>'It matters not to me what she is,' murmured
Ice-Plant coldly.</p>

<p>'Where does she come from?' whispered Myrtle
to her neighbour Cape Jasmine.</p>

<p>'From a hedgerow,' was the reply, but uttered
so that all around her heard the answer.</p>

<p>'Only a Wild-flower!' was the general exclamation.
'What presumption to come amongst us!'</p>

<p>Then a chilling silence fell upon them all,
except when they spoke to each other; but, after
that unlucky explanation of her origin, it was as
though they ignored her very existence&mdash;she was
with them, still not of them.</p>

<p>And, strange to say, our little friend, who was
so ready with words among her compeers, was
completely silenced by these disdainful beauties,
and, instead of replying, and holding, or rather
maintaining, her position there, she shrank, as it
were, abashed and ashamed of her lowly origin.</p>

<p>Was this the triumphant reception she had
expected? Where was the homage her beauty was
supposed to exact, and where the admiration of her
manners and elegance generally? Ah me! she
was only a little wayside blossom after all, pretty,
it is true, and suited to the quiet hedgerow, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
without the merits or the talents to raise her to
a higher place. Better far the humble friends,
the lowly mossy bank where she had grown in
peace and rest (save for her own unquiet ambition),
than the grandeur and contempt which now were
hers.</p>

<p>So day after day passed on, and the florist who
had brought her from the shady lane, hoping he
had discovered a lovely and rare flower, saw with
regret that his treasure was fading; the heated
atmosphere of this splendid conservatory was too
great for her to bear, and she was pining away
for the fresh air and freedom of her old home;
but, above all, she longed for the kindly if rough
sympathy of her humble friends; the cold society
of these exotics was gradually yet slowly killing
her! In vain was the owner's care lavished upon
her&mdash;it would not do; the delicate petals shrank
up witheringly, the slender green leaves became
shrivelled and dying, so in kindness he took her
from the gorgeous palace, which she quitted gladly,
without one sigh of regret, and carried her back to
the shady lane, the once despised hedgerow, and
carefully placed her in the very spot from which
she had been taken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the home for her!</p>

<p>Sadly she turned her dim eyes to the old friends
around, who gazed upon the sorrow-stricken
Flower pityingly and without reproach.</p>

<p>'I have returned to die,' she murmured. 'Ambition
which has pure and holy aspirations is
laudable in all; but I mistook pride for that
which is more noble, and I am punished. Do not
blame me,' she pleaded piteously, 'but give me
your pity, and when I am gone, think with tenderness
upon the poor little Wild-flower who knew,
when too late, that her place was best and
happiest when among the humble blossoms by
the peaceful hedgerow!'</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE HONEYSUCKLE AND THE BUTTERFLY&mdash;HUMILITY
AND PRIDE.</h3>


<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_dropo.png" width="129" height="190" alt="O" style="margin-top: -.5em;" /></span><span class="upper">ne</span> early spring day, a little shoot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Honeysuckle was putting forth its
tendrils low down on the ground at
the foot of a quickset hedge. As yet it
was but a weakly sprig, not knowing its own
strength, nor even dreaming that it would ever
rise far above the earth. Yet still it was very
contented, drawing happiness from its lowly
surroundings, happy in living, and feeling the
warm sunshine kissing its fragile leaves.</p>

<p>Close by, there was a strange, dark, oblong mass,
and the little Honeysuckle tried to imagine what
it could possibly be, for it never moved, nor evinced
emotion of any kind; and yet it was alive, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
people would take it up, examine it, then put it
down again, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>'It is only a common Chrysalis!' But what
<i>that</i> was the Honeysuckle knew not.</p>

<p>At last, one day, when the sun was shining very
brightly indeed, and the air was warm, and filled
with the sweet breath of spring, to her great surprise
she saw this peculiar object move, then by
degrees the dark brown casing was cast aside, and
she saw that it had wings!</p>

<p>'Why, what are you?' she questioned, in utter
amazement at this marvellous transformation.</p>

<p>'Me!' he replied. 'Oh, I am a Butterfly, and
you will see that very soon I shall become most
lovely, such gloriously tinted feathers will deck
my wings, all the world will be lost in admiration,
I shall be so beautiful!'</p>

<p>'And will you let me see you then?' the meek
little flower asked humbly.</p>

<p>'Oh yes! certainly you shall gaze upon me,' he
answered, with a mighty air of condescension.</p>

<p>'But will you not always remain here?' she
questioned, pleased at the idea of having so charming
a neighbour.</p>

<p>'Dear me, no! I should think not, indeed. Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
I shall fly far away from this humble neighbourhood!'
was his exclamation.</p>

<p>'What! and leave me?'</p>

<p>'Certainly! what else could you expect?' he
replied. 'My ambition could not endure such a
humdrum existence as yours; with these gay-coloured
wings of mine I shall soar to higher
realms, and be courted and caressed where'er I
go!'</p>

<p>'Oh that I had wings like yours, or that you
clung to earth!' sighed the tender-hearted Honeysuckle,
who, from having been so long in close
companionship with the dark, unsociable Chrysalis
had actually grown to like him.</p>

<p>'Nonsense! what a ridiculous wish!' exclaimed
the gaudy insect, who did not share his little
friend's feeling of regard. 'Why, I should die
if I were rooted to one place! I require a large
sphere in which to move about; while as to you&mdash;I
doubt if ever you will rise higher in the
world than you are now.'</p>

<p>Not a kind remark to make, certainly, and it
sadly grieved the humble flower to hear the Butterfly
thus speak.</p>

<p>'And yet,' she sorrowfully mused, 'perhaps he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
is right; I know I am but a little green plant, very
small, and very lowly, whilst he is so noble and
beautiful with his gorgeous wings. Still, it is
heart-rending to think I shall never rise above the
sordid earth, always remain a mere groundling!
But never mind,' she added more cheerfully;
'even groundlings can do good sometimes, so I'll
take courage, and hope for the best.'</p>

<p>Not many days after this, the Butterfly called
out joyfully to his little admirer,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Good-bye! good-bye! See! I have acquired
my full beauty, so now I am off to entrance the
world with my perfect loveliness! I <i>think</i> I
am an Emperor, though I am not quite sure; but
there! people will soon appreciate me, and, of
course, will acknowledge my claims to admiration.'</p>

<p>'And are you really going?' she asked sadly.</p>

<p>'Yes, of course! I am perfect now, and could
not possibly stay <i>here</i> any longer;' looking round
contemptuously upon his humble surroundings.
'But I'll come and see you again, perhaps; <i>you</i>
are sure to be found in the same place!'</p>

<p>And away he flew with a mocking laugh; his
gay wings fluttered merrily in the sunshine as he
poised above the gorgeous garden flowers a while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
then he sped away into distance, and was lost to
sight, whilst the little Honeysuckle felt very
lonely as she watched him disappear.</p>

<p>'Oh dear me!' she sighed; 'I feel rather sad
now he has gone. It certainly must be very nice
to rise a little in the world, not to be'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Take hold of my hand, my dear,' said a kind
Bramble, who happened to hear the flower lament
her lowly fate. 'I may perhaps be able to give
you a lift up.'</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you very much,' was the response;
'but I fear your kindness would be thrown away,
for I do not think I shall ever be more than I am
at present.'</p>

<p>'One can never know, until he has tried, what
may be done,' was the encouraging rejoinder.
'Look at me, for example! I am only what is
called a Bramble, very much despised by some
folks, no doubt; but then, who despises the fruit
I bear? Why, every one likes the hardy blackberry,
and I believe "by your fruit ye are
known."'</p>

<p>'But I shall never yield fruit,' the Honeysuckle
exclaimed; 'and as to flowers'&mdash;</p>

<p>'You are as yet only a green sprig of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
&mdash;what I know not,' interrupted the Bramble
sharply. 'But courage, child; take fast hold of
me. I am rough but trusty; so take my hand.'</p>

<p>'I fear to climb!' cried the other timidly.</p>

<p>'Nonsense, child! nothing is done without an
effort. Only, when once you have secured a
chance, hold it fast,' was the caution given.</p>

<p>So she ventured to put forth a tender green
tendril and clasp her kind friend's helping hand,
which, if rough and thorny, was certainly honest
and true.</p>

<p>It is very seldom in this world that the humble
and shrinking find friends ready and willing to
raise them from the ground; for there is such a
rush and scramble to reach the temples of 'Fame'
and of 'Mammon,' that each one elbows the other
in the crowd. Some of the weaker ones get
sadly pushed to the wall, others are trampled
under foot, and it is only the very boldest and
most daring of the throng who ever reach the
desired goal.</p>

<p>But amongst the flowers it is not so; for how
many of the weak ones cling for support to others,
and, through their tender care, gain strength and
beauty. And this was the case with the Honey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>suckle;
she felt so secure resting on that strong,
protecting arm, that by degrees she began to gain
courage, and to feel her own power. The Bramble,
too, perceiving she was something more than a
mere 'little green sprig of something,' kindly
encouraged her to persevere in her upward course.
So she clambered up higher and higher; the
delicate green tendrils became firmer and stronger,
and at length, after much painful toiling and
many a disappointment, she reached the highest
summit of her hopes&mdash;the top of a quickset
hedge!</p>

<p>'Oh, how can I thank you all!' she joyfully
cried, when from her lofty position she gazed
around on beautiful scenes undreamt of ere this,
and then looked back upon the toilsome path she
had travelled, and beheld the many kind friends
who had helped her on her way, each one of
whom was now rejoicing in her success; 'and you,
dear Bramble, my first generous guide'&mdash;</p>

<p>'We are all very pleased to see that at last you
have succeeded in your efforts, my dear,' interrupted
that sturdy friend; 'and, what is more,
we do not fear you will prove ungrateful, you are
sure to remember us.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>'Indeed, indeed I ever shall!' cried the happy
little flower. 'Can I ever forget those who loved
me when I was poor and lowly? that would be
cruel and unkind.'</p>

<p>And so it proved; for, as the summer grew
warmer, and her lovely blossoms opened to the
bright sunshine, she in her gratitude showered
them over those dear ones who had helped her
in the days of her poverty; and the fragrant
blossoms thus spread over the hedge and the
bramble enhanced their beauty, and rendered
them still more lovely in the eyes of the
passers-by.</p>

<p>'Dear me!' exclaimed the Butterfly, as one
very hot day he alighted to rest upon one of the
Honeysuckle's leaves. 'Dear me!' he repeated,
surveying her critically; 'why, really I did not
know you again. How did you contrive to get
so high up in the world?'</p>

<p>'Kind hearts, loving hands, helped me,' was
the simple answer given.</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed!' he curtly said. 'Well, I owe
gratitude to no one. I suppose you will not get
any higher?' he questioned, after a pause.</p>

<p>'No,' she replied, with her usual humility;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
'and even if I could, I would not wish it; for,
living as I do amongst all who are dear to me, I
have no higher ambition.'</p>

<p>'You were always a faint-hearted thing,' exclaimed
the insect, quite forgetting even to be
commonly polite, so elated was he with pride.
'Just compare the difference in our lives! I fly
here, I fly there, now on this flower, now on that.
Ah, mine is a glorious life! nothing but pleasure
and excitement all the livelong day. Confess,
now, would you not like to be me?'</p>

<p>'No,' she answered, with the utmost sincerity;
'I am so happy here, I would not change my lot
even for a career so brilliant as yours.'</p>

<p>'What a taste!' he exclaimed, with scornful
pity; 'no wonder you remain a hedge-flower!
Why, poets write about us, and there is actually
a song called "I'd be a Butterfly." Only think
of that!' he exultantly cried.</p>

<p>'What! and have a pin stuck through one's
head, and to be suffocated with camphor, merely
for the sake of being placed in a glass-case for
people to stare at!' ejaculated Spleenwort, with a
dash of malice in his tone.</p>

<p>'Don't talk of such things, you common flower!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the insect angrily exclaimed. 'I'll not stay here
any longer to listen to such vulgarity. I prefer
more refined society!'</p>

<p>And away he flew, evidently very much disturbed
in his mind by what Spleenwort had
remarked as occurring to butterflies in general,
although he would not acknowledge that it was so,
even to himself, but tried to banish the thought
by indulging more freely in what he considered
pleasure. You see&mdash;poor, giddy flutterer&mdash;he did
not like to hear the plain truth spoken; flattery
would have pleased him better, yet truth, though
sometimes bitter, is a wholesome tonic when taken
properly.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The summer days sped fast, for Father Time's
scythe is never idle, and he was gradually, though
slowly, mowing down the flowers which had
garlanded the sunny hours. The leaves once
so green were changing now, assuming their
glowing autumn tints, whilst some would fall
fluttering to the ground with a gentle sigh of
weariness, as the cold winds were rustling
by. Then the stern northern gale came sweeping
along, proclaiming to the forest trees that winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was on her way; and a shudder would pass
through their sturdy branches when they heard
the tidings, for they feared her chill, icy breath.</p>

<p>The bees took refuge in their well-stored hives,
the ants had barred their outer doors, and retired
to their most secluded apartments; even the garden
spider was sheltered in his home&mdash;only the once
gay butterfly was homeless and friendless.</p>

<p>'Shelter me, shelter me, dear Honeysuckle,'
moaned the shivering insect, coming back to the
old home in the day of his sorrow. 'I am so
cold, so weary!'</p>

<p>'Poor thing!' the tender flower exclaimed, with
the utmost pity, forgetting now all former slights.
'Creep under my leaves, perhaps they may shield
you. But your beautiful wings, how came they
so torn and colourless?'</p>

<p>'The pitiless storm last night fell upon me and
crushed me to the earth in its fury,' he answered,
with difficulty, for he was so feeble. ''Tis true
the gleams of sunshine to-day have revived me
a little; but alas! I am dying! my brief day is
over, and there is no one to give me a refuge save
you!'</p>

<p>'Where are your gay friends?' she asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>'those
with whom you sported throughout the
livelong summer hours?'</p>

<p>'Gone far from me,' he answered bitterly;
'they were but friends of the fleeting sunshine,
and I in the day of my power thought but of
myself, and now&mdash;I am left alone to die!'</p>

<p>The Honeysuckle was deeply moved; she remembered
no more his haughty pride, she only
saw that <i>now</i> he was ill and in sorrow; so she
placed her clinging tendrils gently around him,
trying thus to keep the poor Butterfly under the
shelter of her protecting leaves.</p>

<p>Night came stealing on, folding her sable
curtains over the earth; and it was a wild night,
for not a star shone in the skies, all was dark and
dreary, for the Storm King was abroad in all his
mighty strength. The fierce gales came with
terrific power, tossing the lordly ships as they
nobly braved its fury, but causing, oh, so many
loving hearts to fervently pray 'for those at sea.'
No wonder, then, that when the cold grey dawn
awoke the early flowers, they saw the poor
crushed Butterfly lying dead! close beside the
little Honeysuckle, whose trustful, meek heart he
had once so cruelly derided.</p>
